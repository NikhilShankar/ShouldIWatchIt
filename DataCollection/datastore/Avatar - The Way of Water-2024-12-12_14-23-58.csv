I can not speak, so if I said words or sentences and the special program mistranslated into your language, I apologize in advance to your esteemed father, from the bottom of my heart and from the bottom of my heart, that the letters and words Call me to the end and call me a person orDo not consider me a rude person and do not consider me a rude person and judge me correctly and after reading my writings, just put yourself in my place for a few minutes and imagine yourself in my place, maybe if you have an awakened conscience and There was love and affection in your hearts, of course, if you did not have pride and arrogance, understand me and give me the right, and again, maybe, maybe, maybe you did something and you did it for me and you took me from You saved this great tribulation that I hope will not happen to any living thing, of courseI do not very much hope that anyone will take my hand and save me from this misfortune, but I am writing so that I can at least be comfortable in front of my conscience and not blame myself later if I cry out for this cruelty, oppression, and captivity that has fallen on me. All the doors are closed to me, even the eyes of God are blind to see the oppression that is being done to me, and the ears of God are blind to hearing the cries of my constant cries, my midnight cries, my daily sufferings, my daily prayers and the jurists and The cries of my every moment from this oppression, oppression and cruelty that from the beginning of my life, fromThe first events of my life that I remember are deaf. So how can I hope for others when God has done nothing for me and trapped me in a cruel, cruel, cruel, and oppressive family? I am Morteza, I am from Iran, I am blind, I am 34 years old, I am unemployed because in our country, Iran, there is no work for healthy people, let alone disabled people like me. I live with my family in a small town in Iran. Of course, in appearance, they are my family, but in reality, they see me as their own enemy, and with me, who am their child, only bI was born blind, and I was not to blame for this, but my parents, because they were illiterate, considered me as a disgrace only to myself for my blindness and disability, and were always tortured as severely as possible. They beat me to the point where they threatened me with a knife. They put me to sleep and put the knife on my neck, and I was terrified and scared. Get up and until fullThe thin skin of my hand burned, they would not let me go. And they tortured me many, many times, to the point that my brothers, with the support of my parents, tortured me in front of my parents' indifferent eyes, and told me that I was blind. You are and you should be tortured to the extent that they created the belief in me and in my mind that anyone who is blind or disabled should be tortured because it is a disgrace to the family and society. And unfortunately, their torture is still going on, and only a kind of tortureThey do not consider it for him, so how can I complain to someone who considers my law as his property, of course, the current laws in Iran. Unfortunately, the government does not have a place for people like me to go and live. I really have no choice, either I have to commit suicide or I have to stay in the same house that my family has turned into hell for me, under the severe mental and physical torture that my family inflicts on me. And more than ever with a horrible gradual death that tormentedI want to stay. So if you still have a little mercy, fairness, conscience, compassion, love, humanity, knowledge, ideology, humanity and altruism, help me, hold my hand, reach my cry. If you are in contact with institutions and organizations affiliated with the International Committee of the Red Cross, or if any of you are a member of human rights organizations or the International Committee of the Red Cross or Red Cross organizations in free and pro-human rights countries, listen to my writings, my voice and my cry. Come on, maybe they're a little fair and think of me and a way toSave me from the clutches of ostensibly wolves, of course, if human rights institutions and organizations and the Red Cross actually support human rights, if you are a citizen of a free country or a citizen of a free country like the United States, Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Norway, You have Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the European Union. Send me invitations, arrange for me to leave this house, which is worse than hell, so that maybe I too can taste freedom. If you have capital, you are rich, you have money, at least help meLeave the messengers, so that all the photos on my personal pages in the messengers and social networks are from 8 years ago, that is, for 8 years ago and 5 years ago. I have not even traveled for many years, because our city is a small city. It is sad for a disabled person to leave home, it is sad for a disabled person, the streets of our city are not adapted so that a disabled person can easily be at least a little out of home. And I'm really depressed at home, especially with this family that is always torturingAre. Of course, I do not care if I travel or not, because my problems are so great that not traveling travels much more than my other or other problems. In your opinion, can a person who eats only one meal in 48 hours, which is a good meal, even a moderate meal, but also any garbage he gets, take pictures, travel or not, and other things? Slowly, someone who breaks his heart at every moment, of course, the work of my heart is no longer broken and my heart is on fire andIt is burned, and this fire is getting more and more hot and burning, and it is burning and ashes my whole being. So I hope that if you do not hear the sound of my heart breaking, at least be fair and feel the smell of my heart burning, away from arrogance, arrogance, misguidedness, ethnicity, race, skin color, shape and appearance for the sake of humanity and for Humanity and honor that you have, just imagine yourself in my place for a few minutes, see yourself in my place and think, if far away from you, God forbid, you would be in my place.Did you ??? Were you satisfied that someone was making fun of you or disrespecting you, or did you laugh at you in response to your message and pain and heart ?, so my dear friends and those who wrote my writings to you Please, if you do not want to do anything for me, at least do not make fun of me, do not laugh, and if you do not want to help extinguish the fire inside me that burns my heart, at least do not spill oil and gasoline with ill-considered language, words and expressions, and this is far from knowledge, honor, It is humanity and family originality. If you want to give me anyPlease help me do not send me a message on YouTube because I can not transfer messages from YouTube to the translation program that I have installed on my phone, and as a result, because I am not fluent in any language other than Persian, I can not understand the meaning of messages.

The whole movie is basically younger son do something stupid, older son gets hurt. Quaritch catch kids, younger son calls Jake, Jake calls Neytiri, she kills tons of humans with her bow and arrow. Rinse and repeat for 3 hours. Opps, water chief forgot he went to get his daughter. No human seems to be able to hit a barn 3 feet away. Arrows that used to just bounce off gunships' canopy now goes right through them. Humans forgot they have long range missiles and spaceships that can drop bomb from space.

Oh, and sprinkle in avatar 1 plot during the repeat. Join local. Local girl order to train boy. Catch animal. Learn to ride animal. Fail riding animal. Locals laugh.

I barely made it through that movie without walking out!! Burn that piece of worthless garbage where no one sees it again!! 🔥🔥

There is no comparison here as this was more in line with Black Panther's storyline. Which is a more fair comparison I think.

It was like the whole movie was a shout out to the first movie and referensing the first one all the time.

I'm not an average movie goer so I need something more stimulating than great visuals which it is. If you love great visuals and 3D this is a movie for you. 

If you enjoy great stories however this will feel like a movie you already seen though. So not very impressed with a story they had 13 years to work on.

UgzdB0d4qe4ewrxJ4Qp4AaABAg.9iS5RSZig2m9jnLnl4qdIS," @controlman7490  As you said yourself, it's been ""replayed multifarious times"".  There's a reason it's called ""dances with smurfs"" and Fern Gully in Space, and  Alien Pocahontas etc.  It's a bore.  The characters are simplistic and one dimensional, the villains are mustache twirling baddies. The only thing they were missing were giant sacks with dollar signs on them.   Jake has the most predictable character ""arc"" as possible.  Sure, he starts off as an insider for the the big, bad corporation but that lasts all of a few minutes.  

 For the life of me I have no idea why Sam Worthington or Michelle Rodriguez keep getting work: they are terrible, cardboard, dull actors who are about as exciting as beige paint.     Giovanni Ribisi phoned in his role, despite being a fairly good actor in some things.  Stephen Lang was only one who really seemed to take pride in his role, which is not a good thing: you are not supposed to root for the bad guy.  But the personalities were so bland otherwise I couldn't wait for them to kill all the smurfs.  In fact the only sequence I really enjoyed was when they blew up ""home tree"" or whatever it was called.  

And then there are the plot contrivances.   The humans decide to blow up the brain tree (or whatever it was called) so they do a PAINFULLY slow, low altitude bombing run and the Navi aerial super-commandos pounce upon them and save the day (or something, I don't quite remember).   
The problem?  High altitude bombings have been in practice since WWII.  Suddenly the humans had completely forgotten that have have spacecraft and supersonic aircraft that could blow up the brain tree from a safe distance.   Not to mention we have an entire civilization that ""lives in peace and harmony, balanced with nature""...which also happens to have a whole warrior caste.   Which is it?  A bunch of pacifist blue cat people? Or brave and fearsome warriors?  You can't have both.    You call that coherent and logical, I call it stupid.   

And lastly there is the terrible James Cameron dialog.  He's kind of (in)famous for it, for example we have the face-palm-inducing ""Jack, I'm Flying!""  from Titanic, ""Looks like we have skynet by the balls now don't we?"" In T2, and the ridiculously corny ""I see you"" in Avatar.  

People love garbage.  Glitzy, shiny, 3d garbage.  I get it.  The audience doesn't want to think, they want to be spoon fed simple stories with minimal thinking as long as things glow, or explode, or are filled with one-liners.  They want cookie-cutter heroes and villains.  All navi are noble savages, all of the corporate types are greedy, evil, unwise, cruel and foolish.

They justify self defense, not freeform violence. And show people what NOT to do to others. For example, what the humans did to the Na’vi.

UgzdB0d4qe4ewrxJ4Qp4AaABAg.9iS5RSZig2m9qV7gL8hdwv,"​ @tunnellightstudios5183  , I've watched AVATAR a gigillion times, and each time I catch something new in it. By itself, I loved every minute of it, and the ONLY thing I wished for, was more depth of the World, Pandora, not just fleeting sight's of the flora and fauna. I wanted more of the N'evi's living, like how they split up jobs, how the tribe gained enough food for the whole tribe's dinner, what did Jake do with the buck he shot in his ""clean kill"", did he field dress it, or slung it over his shoulders' to bring it back to the Tribe for a mass meal, or did they let it dry out for space jerky? Where did they get their clothing (minimal as it was), and did they make their own jewelry?
I saw ""bird's"" and wondered if that was where they got the feather's they wore. But that's why I watch it over and over again, I want MORE!  Thank God, Cameron has made a volume 2, ""The Way Of Water"", and I immersed myself in the Oceanic flora and fauna, and I've watched it right after the first one, so many times, a double-header marathon of Pandora and the N'evi, and can't wait for his third installment of AVATAR!
It's the only thing that is worth waiting for in this bad time we are in, mentally going back to Pandora is keeping me going, as I am worse off than the human Sully, bedridden and disabled, but seeing the marvelous World of Pandora keeps me going on, waiting for the Next Adventure in the third installment! ✨😊✨",1 year ago,@marymyersme2489,UCyxoio0IB9Cjs8NxOhbc9ZQ,0,,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_mDDrFv3CczXLQt9nk95-Mdg4_kipsoPNeAByvQBS2AJa3d=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,True,1702408873.402439,Avatar - The Way of Water,7.6

I went to go see Avatar at the pictures with my Mum when it originally released when I was 11. But initially I didn't really want to and wasn't excited to go see it (which I kept to myself) because I mistakenly thought we were going to see Avatar the Last Air Bender. I never saw any trailers for James Cameron's Avatar and had only seen the teaser trailer for The Last Air Bender movie (which didn't interest me as I'd never seen the series), so I thought that was what we were going to watch as I was completely unaware there was another film coming out with Avatar in its name. 

So, I was really surprised to see what the film actually was when we got there. I was completely blown away and I've loved the film for years. I went to go see the re-release in September and it was amazing, I just adore how alive the world feels.

All the actors are in suits with tracker dots on their faces and cameras attached to their heads, to record and capture facial expressions and body movements to aid in the animation being smoother, and more realistic. It's incredibly diverse, expensive technology, and this movie took 13 years because James needed it to work underwater. He put the money, time, and research into developing it with his team, and it unlocks so much more potential for other animators and directors. We have them all to thanks for mo-cap being able to accurately capture faces and bodies underwater now!

Depends on what mindset you intend to watch it with and how it is perceived frim said view. Obviously the world in the movie is all ""fake"", then again I could argue there's  a rality to it too, but that not the point I am getting at.  Sometimes the messages behind it are much bigger and not always directly gestured towards. A lot of people look at a lot of things very literal and on such a surface level. I find it odd that it a lot of people do not think more, like to question if there is more than what meets the eye. I feel a good story doesn't always deliver all that directly, it's heavy on the metaphorical and has literal senses simultaneously. If it's not for you, it's not for you, but it doesn't always make it a bad story or meaning overall.

......however, in seeing your comment, I was reminded of A) just how many amazing, hardworking, DELIGHTFULLY creative and inspired artists worked on making this wonder of imagination come to life, and B) how.....-even if the story, characters, etc are once again utterly insulting trash.....how this would still be ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL to watch as a kid; to be able to see lush, vibrant alien environments SO REAL that they almost feel like they're there themselves............I don't want to take that chance to blossom the imagination of young children away from them.

These guys can think whatever they want about Avatar 2 and hate it as much as they want because we all have different tastes, but for me, Avatar 2 is at least on par with Avatar 1 and I think it's just slightly better. For those who say it's the same as the first one, how? The first one is all about introducing the world of pandora and getting us introduced to Jake and Neytiri but the second one is all about expanding the world and focusing on Jake and Neytiri's family.

Story is decent, they're saying that ""oh it's just the same as the first one"" well it's not! It is a re-discovery and Jake and his family needs to learn the ways of being part of the Metkayina, so what's wrong with that? Some critics are saying that it lacks emotionally? Not at all!

Yes it may have been long but it obviously would've been too cramped and everything might've happened so fast you would've missed the point as to why its long. It not only introdiced a new type of avatars and new animals, showed that Quadrich was created into an avatar and had to go through the learning process like Jake. Yes the plot may be similar to the first movie with Lo'Ak taking Jake's place as the outcast and basically findinding his mate in the process  but it also introduced some key mystery characters like Spider and Kiri. Also, the end scenes showing that Spider saved Quarich is an obvious point to another movie in my opinion. But apart all that its a visual masterpiece.

UgysuKLs-rCwaAdOygR4AaABAg.9l7-W6sG5TZ9nd3dgaC29A,"The movie is terrible. Completely style over substance. Massive logic flaws, way too long. Spoilers from here on: First of all, it makes no sense at all for Sully and his family to leave their tribe, who have been fighting the humans for atleast a year by that time and have gathered experience, training and modern weapons. It's not like they will stop fighting the humans or the humans will stop hunting them, so they're in the same danger wheter Sully and his family are with them or not. By leaving them, Sully actually endangers them more than he would if he would stay, because he leaves them with an inexperienced leader to fight in his place (he says so himself). The ""children playing in the water"" sequences were mostly unneccessary, I'd say atleast 2/3rd of these sequences should have been cut. And the death of the oldest son was probably one of the worst death scenes I've seen in a movie for a long time (comparable to an 80s c-level action movie). First of all, the wound he got would have been fatal immediately (shot through the heart and his spine, and yes, Navi have their heart there too, as can be seen from the ""control your heartbeat to breathe"" sequence a few hours earlier), and even if it wasn't, he wouldn't have been able to walk with the severed spine. And even if that wouldn't have been the case, the whole sequence was so, so bad, entirely cliche. And lastly, the little mesiah story was way too much on the nose (the ""virgin birth"" of a girl with special powers...). If I'm generous, I'd give it a 3/10, and that's very generous. It's basically a tech demo for how good the crew is able to animate water.",1 year ago,@MyRegardsToTheDodo,UCVoSu69TnkGeBtx_jzszhvA,20,,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_m6tCZMVSIXRKGZ4ZO5A227ixn9yXaH6dqjcJJFpYM=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,True,1702408892.996051,Avatar - The Way of Water,7.6
UgysuKLs-rCwaAdOygR4AaABAg.9l7-W6sG5TZ9nmtfmY3d-L," @MyRegardsToTheDodo   miserable take imo. If that’s how you see it then that kinda sucks for you lol. Pretty sure Jake was trying to get his family to leave the tribe after his sons got themselves in trouble in the train sequence and then when Quaritch literally had his kids. Id say it was shocking to them that Quaritch was back first off and then he was threatening the Sully family directly. Seems like a decent reason. It didn’t end up being the correct move for them seeing how things play out because Jake was acting out of fear a lot of the movie and running from his past sins. Those sins have fallen on his sons. Jake running from being Toruk Makto was a mistake and part of what led to his sons death. Or did you miss that?? Nitpicking the Neteyam’s death and like the time it took him to die is absolutely hilarious to me. Like it’s a movie… about blue aliens… and you’re complaining about how realistic the death compared to the wound was or something? Which is fine but it’s hilarious to do. I couldn’t care less if you like the movie or not, but I think to say it’s “terrible” is objectively not true even tho the art of film is extremely subjective. Also idrc if the visual effects are indulgent or whatever, I thought trying to innovate new technologies and push the boundaries in film was a good thing lmao, I’ve never understood that pov on the internet. The movie isn’t perfect, like most all movies. The story was pretty straight forward but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. It’s what you make it. Idk it was refreshing for me to see an action blockbuster without a superhero and the end was a very personal conflict and not some generic army clash bs.

UgysuKLs-rCwaAdOygR4AaABAg.9l7-W6sG5TZ9o0_Bg4tL60," @MyRegardsToTheDodo  1. ""way too long"". People complain when movies are split into two (Part 1 and Part 2). They gave us a good movie that was 3 hours long. I agree that for cinema viewing, it needed a break halfway (around when the tulkun came back). But 3 hours is not long at all.

2. ""it makes no sense at all for Sully and his family to leave their tribe"". It does, they didn't know that the humans wanted to pacify the entire planet and settle there. They thought they were just back for resources. It was only we viewers who knew at that point. He saw the Colonel reincarnated and almost kidnapped his children. Heck the Colonel's mission was to capture and Kill Jake and it was obvious. Spider knew a lot and he fled the forest to keep his family safe, the inexperienced leader was still a warrior, just not experienced at leadership, we all start somewhere....Jake had his start, just like a talented engineer might be experienced at engineering just not a leading a team. But they will adjust over time.

3. ""The ""children playing in the water"" sequences were mostly unneccessary""....This was a movie about migration, being outsiders, it had to show the progress, the kids adjusting to the environment and learning their ways. It was necessary to show progress, from holding their breaths better to riding the animals and being comfortable at sea.

4. As for the Son's Death. He never walked, he was shot at the very end while he was diving into the water. The bullet hit him from the back, to the left of his spine, hit is lung, missed his heart by a bit and exited through the front...He was not hit through the spine or heart, he did not walk with those injuries, as soon as he fell into the water, he needed help moving till his death, Navi are also built different so their bodies can take more damage from human weapons.....Just like when the tulkan hunter was amazed and commented on the Tulkan that got shot with an explosive harpoon to the chest and was still running for a while.

Just say you didn't like the movie and move on, your points are terrible......at worst the movie was a 7/10, at best an 8.5 or 9/10.

No, Sully wasn't their main target, the humans' main target was to break the Na'vi rebellion and Sully was this rebellion's leader and one of the rebellion's main assets, due to his knowledge (and of course he was a symbol for said rebellion). And Sully knew that, and he knew that the humans would go after him and his family no matter where he would go (and if he didn't know, he was either really dumb or really naive). And he also knew that the woodland tribe would keep on fighting, with or without him (he said so himself), so the humans wouldn't just simply leave them alone. So instead of staying with the group that was already under siege and would be whether or not he would stay there, he left and dragged other groups into the fight, who had nothing to do with it before. And he endangered his family more by doing so, because he dragged them to unknown terrain, where they had no experience fighting and no weapons matching those of the humans or access to modern medicine (which is also shown as a problem in the movie, that eventually even leads to their discovery). The decision was bad, both from a military and a moral standpoint.",1 year ago (edited),@MyRegardsToTheDodo,UCVoSu69TnkGeBtx_jzszhvA,0,,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_m6tCZMVSIXRKGZ4ZO5A227ixn9yXaH6dqjcJJFpYM=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,True,1702408893.414283,Avatar - The Way of Water,7.6

UgyD7sc6WWjrORamn-V4AaABAg.9hvxAS3-ez-9hwXIoPN6kR," @RavenStarMedia  There's a difference between taking inspiration and ripping off another movie. The Fast and The Furious is a rip off of the original Point Break, Joker is a rip off of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and The Secret Life of Pets is a rip off of Toy Story. Despite some of the obvious changes those movies didn't do anything original for the story to make them stand out from the movies they ripped off. The only thing that makes Avatar stick out from the movies it ripped off are the visuals and CGI. Other than that, it's completely unoriginal and overly cliched. The Lion King actually took inspiration from Hamlet while still adding a lot of elements in it to make it stick out from that story. Sure, you could say it's a rip off of Kimba the White Lion but let's be honest, nobody really cares about that. And as for Star Wars, that took some inspiration from the book Dune and from some classic samurai movies. And again, Star Wars added in elements that made it stick out from the story and other movies it inspired. That's why those movies are heavily praised for being the masterpieces they are. So again, other than the CGI, Avatar has nothing that makes it stick out from movies like Pocahontas, FernGully, and Dances with Wolves in its story. I'm not saying you should hate the movie because of that. I'm just giving you my thoughts and answer here.",2 years ago,@Darkon4580,UC71OFYx2GTSiDpo46HGeIhA,0,,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_lwFIGN8TdaQ_wncSi0k_87ISPl1eM2bG_1Z0lG_cXpzA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,True,1670872905.816262,Avatar - The Way of Water,7.6

The basic premise is the very thing they ALL have in common, and Avatar is exactly like those other movies just on another planet. I guarantee you that if the movie took place on Earth with the exact same plot, then it would've just come off as even more unoriginal than it already is now. And those elements you mentioned doesn't take away the fact that the movie is still incredibly cliched. Not to mention the characters are super generic and incredibly forgettable. And Star Wars does plenty to stand out from The Hidden Fortress. Like different species of aliens, space travel, different planets, the force, incredibly advanced technology, and entire expanded universe at its side.

I thought that this would be important information to share, given the ocean-related context of this video. 35% of all ocean microplastics come from clothing/textiles, mostly polyester, but also acrylic and nylon as well. This is largely due to clothes made of these materials being washed, which causes these clothes to quickly erode, with the microplastic fibers entering the water system and eventually the sea.

There is something about a really big screen. I saw Avatar in IMAX 3D and it was the best movie experience I have ever had. Although I did see the world premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey when I was nine years old and that’s when I became a huge movie buff. You owe it to yourself to see the Avatar sequel on the big screen in 3D then tell me your 85” experience is as good.

Star wars movies 7, 8, 9 and great examples of Mary Sue Characters. Capt Marvel was another. Both were terrible writing and story with female characters with no flaws, no work to get their 'ultimate power' that they use to dominate all males who are either evil, or incompetent, and therefor the Marys had zero appeal, because nobody can relate to a character like that.

And Captain Marvel was flawed in her belief that power was everything and she didn’t need help from anyone. It’s also completely fair for her to be really powerful given that she got her powers from one of the most powerful objects in the UNIVERSE.

Children has diaper humor, children laugh at funny sounds, children are entertained by seeing cute ponies ""save the day"".

Now there is adults who are also into my little pony(most likely they sit on a lower IQ than an average adult, with a tail which overlaps into average etc).

Let's say that you think this is no fact. Then we would have equally many children as adults being enticed by complex humor and movies which are not for the simple minded right?

However, not as many children as adults rate their favorite movie to be Memento, Shutter island, Arrival, The irishman, Life of Brian etc etc. 

Children's favorite movies these days are like ""ARCANE EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT A MOVIE"".

When I was a child I thought Skifree was a fun game. When I am an adult I fail to see it capturing me. That's because today I need to think of multi variable problems on a daily basis where I have to investigate loads of factors to present a good solution. Similarly I am not enticed by games has very few vectors anymore. Which kids are ultra captured by.

So go ahead and make a claim that ""it's not a fact"" but you will be arguing then that equally many adults and equally many kids are finding humor in ""daddy said poopoo"".

So I dare you to present evidence of that fact. O_o

Okay :).
I'm open to changing my mind (definitely no specialist here, have only seen some VFX artists (""Corridor Crew"") videos and it seemed pretty difficult).
Can you direct me to maybe some videos on youtube (or elsewhere on the internet) where they managed to do that?
Or some of your own (If you have done some :)).

It was like the whole movie was a shout out to the first movie and referensing the first one all the time.

I'm not an average movie goer so I need something more stimulating than great visuals which it is. If you love great visuals and 3D this is a movie for you. 

If you enjoy great stories however this will feel like a movie you already seen though. So not very impressed with a story they had 13 years to work on.

UgwS-L4ewHk456qiqRZ4AaABAg.9kZMpK8xDis9nd4-tHjz6s,"The movie is terrible. Completely style over substance. Massive logic flaws, way too long. Spoilers from here on: First of all, it makes no sense at all for Sully and his family to leave their tribe, who have been fighting the humans for atleast a year by that time and have gathered experience, training and modern weapons. It's not like they will stop fighting the humans or the humans will stop hunting them, so they're in the same danger wheter Sully and his family are with them or not. By leaving them, Sully actually endangers them more than he would if he would stay, because he leaves them with an inexperienced leader to fight in his place (he says so himself). The ""children playing in the water"" sequences were mostly unneccessary, I'd say atleast 2/3rd of these sequences should have been cut. And the death of the oldest son was probably one of the worst death scenes I've seen in a movie for a long time (comparable to an 80s c-level action movie). First of all, the wound he got would have been fatal immediately (shot through the heart and his spine, and yes, Navi have their heart there too, as can be seen from the ""control your heartbeat to breathe"" sequence a few hours earlier), and even if it wasn't, he wouldn't have been able to walk with the severed spine. And even if that wouldn't have been the case, the whole sequence was so, so bad, entirely cliche. And lastly, the little mesiah story was way too much on the nose (the ""virgin birth"" of a girl with special powers...). If I'm generous, I'd give it a 3/10, and that's very generous.

They already have I believe 2 or three more coming out within the next decade but if this one flops you can assure that the next ones won't be as popular.  I love the world design of Pandora and its appeal.  So hopefully the plot is good, they don't insert any politics or view points for a checklist, the characters are well rounded.  The villian has a reason, the heros have a purpose.  Trailers can give you chills because they pick specific scenes but the movie is a whole nother ball park.  Take video games, now uea there is a difference I understand that but just think in terms of that.  They put out an insane trailer usually having it look beautiful but its also being used on a computer using few scenes to have less processing power running off of 4k, raytracing, and wver setting set on insane.  But then the game drops and those who can't use such tools find it very disappointing.  That along with other things like lag, bugs, no mouth sycron.

My point is just because the trailer is a bomb.  Doesn't mean all the elements used to make it a movie. People will remember films like there first one because it was new, brought something astounding to the table of film industries.

This is largely due to clothes made of these materials being washed, which causes these clothes to quickly erode, with the microplastic fibers entering the water system and eventually the sea. Ocean Hero is a great search engine that we can use to help clean up larger plastics before they disintegrate into microplastics.",2 years ago,@Servitor-lx1bu,UCRg8YIFIPePk6xFLsZSV2EQ,0,,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nlBilyjMA1U52oKK26XZ_UcnniCFBmVBEaZcWRZocnDN18ZKMnESUSGCHsm8S0Thv9RQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,True,1670872986.730032,Avatar - The Way of Water,7.6

UgwAe0edljuHmIpN5Mh4AaABAg,"There's only one complaint!
As an indigenous person.  I must say the tribal thing in the movie was way off in error.  The people's are surrounded by the miracle of Ey'Wa , and can communicate with everything around them with their pig-tails.  Yet!!!  Kiri is ridiculed for being spiritual when she sees something in the sand.  That's not tribal at all.  You might say , it's just a movie.   
But through a movie you display tribal life in a derogatory way.  In the book , "" Touch the Earth ""
A native person said. "" This isn't a wilderness , it's our home.  But when the white man came here.

Is it enough to simply ... transplant the soul recorded on a flash drive into an ""avatar body""? So everything is simple? I thought the Avatar was a controlled being controlled by the operator under whose guidance this being grew up.
Then a million questions arise, for example, why not record the images of the best warriors on the planet Earth and upload them into Avatars? At the same time, you can grow as many copies of Avatars as you like without fear that they will die .. at least make an entire army of Avatars. It turns out that this is immortality.
Why wasn't Brother Salli uploaded to Avatar by copying his image? Why was Jack needed then? and so on .. A million questions about the film.
