Gladiator,"Some movie should never have a sequel. The first one was epic, together with a hauntingly great soundtrack.",6.4
Gladiator,Should have left it alone.  Russell Crowe was awesome in the original.  It's a classic epic.,6.4
Gladiator,Next: Gladiator Vs. the Invaders from Saturn. Gladiator and the She-Vampires. The Son of Gladiator Against the Amazons from the Center of the Earth! Gladiator Vs. Jesse James,6.4
Gladiator,what is up with Denzel NY accent? man this move feels so hollywoody... They should just called this '  New York gladiator',6.4
Gladiator,"""You either retire a hero, Or you direct long enough to see yourself destroy a legacy...""",6.4
Gladiator,One of the best things about older movies like the gladiator is that there were things that were un-said. Things the audience wanted to hear but were never spoken. It left a mystery among the audience. Hollywood today has completely forgotten that very real concept.,6.4
Gladiator,Ridley Scott making a movie that smacks of his career... The similarities between the corruption and decay of Rome versus the rot in Hollywood is low-key hilarious 😂,6.4
Gladiator,"There is only one Gladiator. His name is  Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And he has his vengeance, in this life or the next. 
Remember that.",6.4
Gladiator,This should never had been a sequel. Gladiator is timeless classic,6.4
Gladiator,"One movie you can never duplicate is Gladiator

Gladiator,This comment section has restored my faith in humanity... for a few minutes at least...,6.4
Gladiator,I can't believe Denzel is doing this. Denzel is the Equalizer.,6.4
Gladiator,"My favorite part is when he yells out, ""IT'S GLADIATING TIME!!!"" and then the crowd cheers!",6.4
Gladiator,"I am moroccan they made the movie in morocco in hot country,probably they wana show the weather was good😊",6.4
Gladiator,​​ @hichamkettaly4246 Morroco doesn't have an old history 🎉.... Hey Mr Italian Roman empire used to extend all the way to subsaharian desert 🎉..... Macrinus was a Numidian (Algeria nowadays) he was born in Cesarius (Cherchel town in Algeria)😎..... Also the king of Numidia Jughurta.....,6.4
Gladiator,"My friend, they are from USA. Be thankful they at least targeted the name of the city.",6.4
Gladiator,"@pepeportella  a man with whom i had some Lines here in facebook, had written me he had worked for a while in Texas. None knew there where Rome was located and he was asked if Rome and Greece were the same country...",6.4
Gladiator,perhaps because gladiator fights took place in summer and not winter,6.4
Gladiator,Well just like people from other countries only see a perception of what America is from fake news most Americans just like most countries only know the history of their own country! Unless you’re someone that is a historian of sorts! Most people don’t know history and could care less what goes on in other countries past or present let alone weather😂😂😂the fact is no one in the world makes better movies than American! This is fact! It’s a movie brother chill out!,6.4
Gladiator,@maxpayne6295  if they make the best movies why they are not accurate about Rome's weather?😐 Really they think we live in a desert here? By the way temperature here in Rome today 15°C cloudy 🌧️🌧️🌧️and rainy.☔☔☔,6.4
Gladiator,@ I understand the logic behind what you’re saying but a lot of people don’t really care about the accuracy of history when it comes to movies! This movie is not based on fact obviously just a good story with crazy visuals! And in my opinion I still believe when it comes to movies Americans make the best that’s just what I believe I’m not taking what you saying isn’t accurate I’m just saying does it really matter?!? Cause for me it don’t could it have been a better movie being made in a cold environment we will never know😂😂😂,6.4
Gladiator,Hollywood always shows any place as the place is visualised by the americans,6.4
Gladiator,"​@The_Monarchist Well, you have a Mediterranean climate with cool wet winters and hot, dry summers...sort of like Southern California, Perth and a handful of other lucky cities.  Your precipitation is about 750 mm/year, more than London or Seattle.",6.4
Gladiator,Because the Coliseum was in the city Constantinople not Rome.  It represented Rome because of conquered lands by Roman rulers. The coliseum was in Africa later politically named the middle east which is the land we know as Istanbul Turkey today.,6.4
Gladiator,@JamesSmithTexas  what's wrong to show the true weather of the city? If i have to make a movie about Texas i don't show snow.,6.4

Gladiator,"exactly, nothing can beat the first one except if you're James Camereon for Avatar 2.",6.4
Gladiator,"the more epic a movie is, the higher chance there will be a sequel.",6.4
Gladiator,yer agree o ntop of that this one looks bad tonot even dw can save this one,6.4
Gladiator,But you will still go watch it.  I know I am.,6.4
Gladiator,If they wanted one. Russell Crowe is still alive and is the best male actor do date with Denzel Washington with both of them and a different storyline we could have witnessed something,6.4
Gladiator,"I will watch the sequel, but Im not impressed by the casting. The lead role lacks the on screen charisma of crow, and who could replace Joaquin pheonix",6.4
Gladiator,"True hope it is not it has great actors on it, however it looks of lesser quality and it looks cheaper some way don't know really how.. .The music",6.4
Gladiator,"Yes top class movies should never ever be remade ! Why Ridley Scott thinks he gas to is beyond me. Of course , I guess, the lure of money is always strong !",6.4
Gladiator,"incorrect. the first was a poor remake of The fall of the Roman Empire 1964.. probably the best cast ever assembled... the film that spawned star wars.. ppl laughed when I said it years ago..Now even Lucas admits it. Gladiator reduces the original film intp 3 fights.. Very poor..Watch the original first, then respond",6.4
Gladiator,"‘Top Gun’ didn’t need a sequel and ‘Maverick’ is even better than the original. An awesome film is an awesome film, and Gladiator II looks awesome. Can’t fucking wait!",6.4
Gladiator,Most sequels are shadows of the original... I'm still going to watch it,6.4
Gladiator,"​ @NnaemekaAmamasi  Who exactly was fighting with the colour of one of the leading character Juba, Djimon Hounsou? As far as I remember - no one!!",6.4

Gladiator,Why wait for 24 years for the part two very weird,6.4
Gladiator,"​ @TeacherTom1  lol, it's a movie bro! If you choose this path John Rambo should never exist",6.4

Gladiator,"What about this generation, well my 15 years old son liked this version way better?",6.4
Gladiator,"I‘ve seen it,it’s excellent …you don’t know what you’re talking about",6.4
Gladiator,The Rap music in the trailer basically just made me shake my head. I'm stilla gonna watch it - part 1 was my first DVD ever. Most Zimmer soundtracks I heard afterwards sounded like a pallid copy of this masterpiece.,6.4
Gladiator,"Except the sequel was amazing, and was a perfect companion piece to the first one..",6.4
Gladiator,How true everytime i watch gladiator (Russel Crowe) and that hauntingly great soundtrack i always cry.😢,6.4
Gladiator,100% agree but the second movie is a great way to continue a story,6.4
Gladiator,"​@mathewyerry2072 it's not trust me it's not! I'd rather say to watch the jake paul ,tyson fight which was more enjoyable than this ""epic"" 😂",6.4
Gladiator,"@ You have horrible taste in movies, cuz that’s the dumbest take I’ve seen 😂.  I wish you knew how to enjoy good movies",6.4
Gladiator,@christoph1596  you seen gladiator 2? You need your eyes checked if you think that's a good movie 😂😂,6.4
Gladiator,"@ it’s great.. I genuinely can’t take people seriously that say it’s a bad movie.. 😂 

I can get minor complaints whatever, CGI, etc.  but to say it’s a bad movie is more comical than anything.. just shows such a horrendous ability to judge movies",6.4
Gladiator,"@christoph1596  well if you think that was a great movie your eyes are painted on! It was shocking! And as i said I'd rather pay to watch the jake paul ,tyson fight !",6.4
Gladiator,"@ That’s actually comical. 

But Explain why it’s so bad?  
I’m genuinely curious? Let’s hear it.",6.4
Gladiator,"@christoph1596  the acting, the super fake cji the horrendous battles  even the fake blood was that bad too, think it was from an 1982 kids Halloween makeup kit😂",6.4

Gladiator,"Yes, and Classic Movie should never have be repeated !  Just like you can not repaint the Mona Lisa !",6.4
Gladiator, @pauljane3323  no I think they should have made a sequel because the princess son belongs to Maximus did you not watch the preview,6.4
Gladiator, @emmettlewis2312  I will not watch it because it would spoil the memory of the one and only great 'Gladiator' !,6.4

Gladiator," @asuntosvarios7456  Lol yeah, but this sarcastic one simply made me smile while idk why the 'vs Predator'  rly made me burst out laughing ahahaha, and it works again XD 🤣🤣, yeah the best one imo, simple and efficient XD. Ty for the crazy laugh ;)",6.4
Gladiator," @asuntosvarios7456  And on top of it, predator is linked to the movies alien, another movies signed by Ridley Scott, like gladiator, so with this movie, gladiator vs predator, the loop would be closed XD, it's like a second joke in the joke XD.",6.4

Are you a Hollywood executive ? Have you contacted Sir Ridley with your planned future Gladiator franchise ? Remember, ALL future winning gladiators are female, preferably lesbian, and the men ALWAYS lose. That should guarantee studio funding.",6.4

Gladiator," @davidundefinedrivera9473  That's true. This agenda is everywhere. But it's just a matter of time until people will react. And then ... maybe back to the good old 80s and 90s. Die hard, Lethal weapon, Schwarzenegger movies, ...",6.4
Gladiator,"Yeah, first Napolean not this--- not a good pattern for a great director",6.4
Gladiator," @SwisstedChef2018  I didn’t see the movie, just the trailer, but I knew it was going to stink bec Joaquin Phoenix was just too old to play the Emperor, the devil is in the details. I’m still convinced that Rod Steiger played the best Napoleon in “Waterloo” 1970 and Christopher Plummer the best Duke of Wellington",6.4
Gladiator,"😂 oh please, how many times does one need to see the same movie. Speaks volumes about the audience, does it not?
Boring Boring Boring",6.4
Gladiator, @redgatecrt  does what speak volumes about the audience? I think a gladiator movie would be a little repetitive but that wouldn’t inherently make it crap. That doesn’t mean you can’t make a great story line without DEI hires and propaganda. The audience is tired of that crap and we just want good story writing back.,6.4
Gladiator," @Hoss999  lol it was made in 2000 dude … but the sequel is amazing, almost as good as the first, and is a perfect companion piece for the first one,. I’m so happy they made it",6.4
Gladiator," @redgatecrt  The good is boring? Not at all. But it speaks a lot about the bored.
The second part was already boring the first time I watched it. Even Denzel couldn't save it.",6.4
Gladiator,@ not sure what it being made in 2000 has to do with anything but if you like the sequel then great. I personally do not like crap writing.,6.4
Gladiator,Yes Ridley is consumed by the Golden Calf of Hollywood Greed !,6.4
Gladiator,"Maximus Decimus Meridius is a fictional character from the 2000 film Gladiator, portrayed by Russell Crowe. While he is the main character in the movie, there were many gladiators throughout ancient Roman history, not just one. Maximus is a creation of the film, and his famous lines reflect his personal journey of vengeance in the story, but they don't represent the historical existence of a single, defining gladiator.",6.4

Gladiator,"You are forgetting Kirk , the original Gladiator. Or maybe you wasn't even born then 🙂.",6.4
Gladiator, @Duncan.Terrace  that's actually my favourite by far I have special edition copy... Stanley Kubrick and Kirk Douglas production by far the best movie ever made in this genre,6.4
Gladiator," @Duncan.Terrace  Watch ‘Gladiator’, pay attention to the moment when Commodus enters the arena to meet the new victorious gladiator and listen to what Maximus says. Then you will understand what I have written. And yes, I was not born when Kirk Douglas starred as Spartacus.",6.4
Gladiator,PURE TRUTH!!!!!! THIS VERSION IS NOT ROME IN ITS HISTORY. NEVER !!!!!!!!,6.4

Gladiator,The history of Hollywood is full of  mediocre money-grabbing duplicates of movie classics!,6.4
Gladiator,I literally think that Todd was legitimately trying to make a movie about mens mental health and the studio tried to milk it so he sabotaged it. Ridley on the other hand is just way past his prime and needs to throw in the rag.,6.4

In the first movie we all know that Maximus was going to get his revenge on his wife and son and of Marcus who he loved so much. We already know the story without it being told. 

This movie however has you spinning in all different directions. The whole story line in the 2nd movie was by far great. Left you on your toes to the very end of thee movie.

Gladiator,O roteiros desses novos filmes parece ser escrito em 30 minutos depois do almoço.,6.4
Gladiator,"I think the issue is they rely too much on CGI and Camera Techniques to make the fight sequence. Back then, Actors and directors has to rely on people actually doing scenes with very little CGI, which requires more creativity.
There was a joke about James Cameron ask Jackie Chan how he filmed the scene where he jumped from a roof Top onto the balcony of another build, 
Jackie Chan replies ""Oh, is easy. The Director said, Action! and then I jumped!""",6.4
Gladiator,"they rely on cgi way too much, and nobody wants to take the risk of making a genuinely good and complicated movie. too much can go wrong. Easier to just make another superhero movie, or make a sequel, because they know it will sell. Things will change when people stop watching the crap they shit out.",6.4

Gladiator,What has he done? Collected a good paycheck for a movie that will not measure up to the original.,6.4
Gladiator,"i dont get people who say shit like this

its not a relationship, your not dating gladiator 1.

Gladiator,Then he proceeds to watch it  st the cinema. Comon this movies looks good!,6.4
Gladiator,It's jus a movie watch it lol then go watch gladiator like most will do,6.4
Gladiator,"Referencing your ""woke"" comment about ""black Roman soldiers,""  Rome had several Emperors from Africa. For example, Marcus Opelius Macrinus and Lucius Septimius Severus. Lucius was one of Rome's greatest emperors. He began as a senator (confirmed to the Senate by Emperor Marcus Aurelius). He was a general and a governor before becoming emperor. He was a warrior emperor, and died in Britain in 211CE waging military campaigns to subdue the Britons and Scots in what was then called Caledonia.He established the original boundary of Londinium (London). When emperor Commodus died (he's in the film), it was Lucius that became the next emperor!

 Also, Rome was almost destroyed during the Punic wars by Carthage, an African city state. A Carthaginian army killed an estimated 70,000 Romans at the Battle of Cannae, 216BCE. And surely you've heard about Hannibal crossing the Alps (with elephants) to attack Rome from the north? Finally, Rome used African soldiers in its legions, especially African cavalry as shock troops! It's too bad this history is still unknown to most Americans. Google: Lucius Septimius Severus to see an image from Roman times of him, his wife Empress Julia Domna (born in modern day Syria). It's NOT ""woke,"" it's untold history! So much of modern American politics is an illusion that has no basis in historical facts.",6.4
Gladiator,bro I was thinking gen3 and Kling got some real competition then realised it's an actually movie. Crazy.,6.4
Gladiator,"It's supposed to just be an unhealthy baboon with mange or something (not sure if they used them in gladiator battles, but it checks out because they had control of bits of africa). Not gonna argue on the quality of the movie because I couldn't agree more 🤮",6.4
Gladiator,"I don’t believe you understand the true meaning of ‘gangster.’ Furthermore, you need to learn your history. During Roman times, people from various parts of the world were recruited into their ranks, including Africans who held high-ranking positions in Roman society. Please educate yourself before making kindergarten comments.",6.4
Gladiator,You may be downplaying Denzel's ability as an artist. He plays a gangster very well. Because that's what the role calls for. You should watch some of his older movies.,6.4
Gladiator,"yeah he is totally out of place and cringe acting in this one , and that´s just the trailer ...",6.4
Gladiator,"Agreed - immediately identifiable - and totally miscast. Denzel is one of my favorite actors but, in no way, does he fit this role. What was Ridley thinking?",6.4
Gladiator,Uh no one spoke English then either. There was NO English....,6.4
Gladiator," @sarahashun1180  your butt got hurt because you didn't understand what the original comment meant. You made it about race. It had nothing to do with that. It is about his style, the way he speaks, it doesn't gel well with the tone of the movie. Neither does that shitty soundtrack they shoved in at the end.",6.4
Gladiator," @justeatingchipsandwatching  Denzel’s face and voice is to modern gangster to be believable in any ancient times lol. He looks so out of place. Nobody talks and sounds like Denzel in ancient times. Those are the exact r*cist stereotypes perpetrated by ignorant people and it’s absurd. He may look out of place to some, but no one spoke or acted like anyone we see in modern films during ancient times, regardless of the actor. That critique perpetuates stereotypes and reflects ignorance. Neither his narration nor his look embodies anything “gangster.” If someone wants to target Denzel, why not critique the entire cast? Ancient Rome was thousands of years ago, and no one in that production represents the actual historical people of the time. Latin was the dominant language, but many other languages were spoken as well. The English language didn’t even exist. The people were shorter and had very different physical features. Moreover, when historical shows or movies are made, they employ a significant amount of ARTISTIC LICENSE! So, I suggest you educate yourself because, frankly, anyone agreeing with such criticisms is either r*cist or lacking in critical thinking.",6.4
Gladiator," @sarahashun1180  U missed his point, he doesn't point out that a black actor is out of place in this movie, but that Denzel Washington, his image with all his previous movies, is not adapted to this movie, and I'm 100% agree with him, I was thinking exactly the same thing, and god know how I like this great actor and person as well btw , but he is too known, and for characters too far from it to be credible in this movie, anyway it's obviously not because he is black if he doesn't fit this role. You completely missed the sense of his comment. Imo another black actor or a less known one  would have been a better choice. Avoid giving lessons while u're not even able to understand the real sense of the comment, there is absolutely nothing r*cist in this comment, u made a mistake, everybody make mistakes, but u simply have to admit it ;), it's not a big deal dw. You may not agree with his opinion, coz it's a subjective question,  but stop seeing r*cism when there is none, a lot of ppl think as well that Denzel doesn't fit this role and absolutely not bcs he is black, so it's not a question of historical  ignorance neither... In this trailer he doesn't fit, perhaps the movie will prove us wrong, perfectly possible, no problem with it, but in this trailer he doesn't fit at all, I'm 100% agree, I'm not r*cist nor in lack of critical thinking ;), some actors fit better than others depending on their way to act, on the public image they have related to their previous roles, etc, whether you admit it or not, and obviously no one in the cast represents the actual historical ppl of the time, but they fit/looks for us (subjective ofc) more adapted, more credible, once again you simply made a mistake, that's all ;). Btw, I think Paul mescal was a bad choice too lol, he looks too much like a brown hair Jake Paul to be credible XD",6.4
Gladiator, @justeatingchipsandwatching  😂🤣😂 Yeah great response from someone who doesn’t have an intelligent answer and whose butt just been pulverised!😁,6.4
Gladiator," @tetrafantome  Well I beg to differ and I say this respectfully because I’ve got no beef with you. Needless to say, I’ve never seen Denzel playing a gangster. She/ he used the words “face and voice is to modern gangster.” What does that actually mean, if that isn’t a racial trope or slur? Moreover, I’ve heard this said about black people in the past and it makes my blood boil. I watched the clip, he didn’t sound anything like a gangster and he definitely wasn’t acting or speaking like one either. In fact, the more I read the comment I find it absurd and nonsensical. She/he also mentioned that he looked out of place as nobody talks or sounds like Denzel in ancient times. It’s a ridiculous comment to make. No, of course not as they mainly spoke Latin and the black guy would’ve been an African. As I’ve already stipulated, none of the cast sound or look like people who lived thousands of years ago, it’s called ARTISTIC LICENSE!",6.4
Gladiator, @tetrafantome  I also thought she missed the point at first but it is a lack of anything resembling a fully formed personality beyond her little non existent crusades that came to the surface in her incoherent ramblings.,6.4
Gladiator," @justeatingchipsandwatching  Who knows, I'm not psychiatrist, but yeah I think she misunderstood and have been a bit tough for nothing, but that can happen, her intention was good anyway imo.",6.4
Gladiator," @sarahashun1180   I guess he was mainly referring to the movie  ""American gangster"" with Denzel Washington as the main character, and also some others, but yeah I can understand you're not agree, as I said, it's subjective but  imo, from my point of view, it was not r*cist statement, just that he played a lot of roles like it, and to be honest, I had the same feeling, that he was not rly the best choice for this role, but as I said, I wait the movie, only the trailer can be misleading I think, even if for me, in this trailer, he doesn't fit the role. He perhaps said it in a awkward way, I can understand it, but it was not referring to the fact he is black anyway , rather to his usual image, in his previous roles, and tbh I'm agree judging by the trailer anyway. Anyway I admire your fight against r*cism :), it was not the case here imo but it was a good intention of you anyway ;)",6.4
Gladiator," @tetrafantome  Perhaps! I came to that conclusion because she/he is East Asian, and I’ve seen similar r*cist comments on YouTube and TikTok. Needless to say, I respect your opinion—it’s all love 🙂",6.4
Gladiator,I can imagine him going into full gangster mode while dressed in a toga!,6.4
Gladiator," @alandl7749  Yeah Denzel, such a great actor, yeah he doesn't fit at all imo, anyway in the trailer, but why not, once again an actor from his caliber deserve the benefit of the doubt haha, but Paul mescal who looks like the third brother of the Jake Paul's family XD, it's clearly an issue for me XD. Paul mescal vs Russel Crowe ... no way XD. Already not hyped at all by a gladiator 2, but yeah, little cast mistakes, and that will not help the movie I think.. compared to the first one ... who knows, a bad buzz stay a buzz lol, but it sounds badly gone for this movie. Not always a good idea making a sequel to a true masterpiece like was/is Gladiator.",6.4
Gladiator, @tetrafantome  Yeah I am a Denzel Washington fan but I’m not sure if this works for him. Maybe we’ve been spoilt by his other roles. I am not a fan of sequels.,6.4
Gladiator," @alandl7749  Yeah, judging only by the trailer he doesn't fit this role at all, but with him I prefer to see the entire result before judging, he is so talented so perhaps this trailer is misleading, let's hope anyway.",6.4
Gladiator,Just because you see him that way doesn't mean everyone else does. Why do you have to put your own preconceived notions over everyone else's novel funjoyment? Selfish.,6.4
Gladiator," @tetrafantome Reading your comments, you seem like an intelligent and empathetic good person, respect to you. I also tend to agree with pretty much everything you said.",6.4
Gladiator," @sarahashun1180  This has nothing to do with race and everything to do with an actor's performance. 

I believe that the original comment is referring to Denzel's performance in this movie being similar to his character in the film 'American Gangster'. Denzel's speech-pattern is reminiscent of a modern-day northerner here in the US. It is completely out of place in a movie set in antiquity. 

Compare this to the way that Joaquin Phoenix expressed himself in the first Gladiator and you can definitely see the difference. The entire purpose of making a movie is to engross the audience in the fictional world that the director created. Casting an actor that may not be a good fit for a role reduces the efficacy of the storytelling.  

Perhaps you should heed your own advice and educate yourself before jumping on people for expressing their opinions.",6.4
Gladiator," @greedokenobi3855  Ohh thanx 😊. Yeah it can so easily degenerating through screens, sometimes ppl tend to judge and condemn a bit fast, but there's always a way to understand and respect other's opinions imo :D. Real 'bad' persons are at the end rarer than we could expect haha, networks in general are like a distorting prism, putting in light some of bad sides of ppl while they are not rly like that actually, unlike the appearances. A bit the bad side of current networks imo. Anyway I usually prefer avoiding too fast judgements haha, I always try to understand ppl, to understand what can be behind the apparences, more interesting and often closer from a kind of 'truth' :D. Oops, sry for the big text XD, tx again anyway :D, I was not expecting it :D",6.4
Gladiator," @tetrafantome  Fully agree! That’s the mindset of a peace maker! Seems like you’re very familiar with the power of ‘killing ‘m with kindness’ and that way the ‘common sense’ that you offer often connects with the person that was initially being negative or a bit toxic. I’m sure you know it doesn’t always work but it suprised me how much times it actually does. Showing people things like  “hey, you’re not each other’s enemy, y’all just misunderstanding each other and might see eye to eye on more things then you’d think” is a beautiful thing. Kudos to you!",6.4
Gladiator," @greedokenobi3855  Yeah it's true :D. Yeah it works more often that we could think :). And it's a bit  in my nature I think, i prefer understanding than judging, Judgement can often be the enemy of understanding, and for me understanding is the key, we can learn so much from other's opinions, no one have the truth, and different points of view is a real wealth actually. And as u say, ppl might see eye to eye more things than they'd think. Understanding of others prevent so many useless/avoidable clash most of times :D, but yeah sometimes a third party can be needed, useful, to temperate haha, u well summarized it :D. Also when 'violence' meet kindness/caring, it get disarmed most of times  XD. Rly nice lil discussion anyway, thank you :D",6.4
Gladiator," @mas33533 😭🤣😂🤣 Roman soldiers: The ""Moorish"" Division of Roman Soldiers stationed at Hadrian's Wall may have included some Black Romans. The term ""Moor"" is generally used to refer to North Africans, but many ""Moors"" who conquered Europe were actually Sub-Saharan Africans. Furthermore, not all North Africans look like Arabs. Like any other continent Africa is a place where people move around. So get your facts right!",6.4
Gladiator," @mas33533  🤔 Hmmm! If you really want to know the truth, there are plenty of documentaries, books, and other resources available for those interested in questioning the outdated narratives perpetuated by past media. Like M. K, I suppose you think Jesus was white and had blonde hair and blue eyes?",6.4
Gladiator," @mas33533  Recruitment Across the Empire: The Roman army recruited soldiers from all over its vast territories, which included provinces in North Africa (like Egypt, Libya, and Mauretania) as well as nearby regions with African populations. This meant the legions were ethnically diverse, including people from various African backgrounds.",6.4
Gladiator," @mas33533  I know the story very well because I have done my research. My argument has always been based on the presence of Black African Roman soldiers. If you read my many posts on this thread, you’ll see that I’ve even used the term “artistic license.” None of the cast members accurately depict the Romans or those who represented the Romans in terms of height, features, or language. Furthermore, I’m not speaking about one specific period; I’m speaking about the broader historical context. It frustrates me that people like “Triple”use words like “gangster” to describe Black people, which truly makes my blood boil. For over a century most of the historical movies, including documentaries have always used artistic license or manipulated the facts in favour of Western culture or audiences. Thank goodness such  r*cism and small mindedness is beginning to change.",6.4
Gladiator," @mas33533  😂 surprisingly I partially agree with you because I’ve had to endure the outdated methods for decades. However if you gave me a choice, I would prefer actors that actually pass as indo Europeans and there are many out there. I’m definitely for historical accuracy🥰",6.4
Gladiator,"​ @mas33533 

Mediterranean is a region... most Romans look like modern northern Italians...",6.4
Gladiator," @mas33533  

No. 

The Romans were descendants of the Keltic Iron Age Nordic population from Austria, that eventually made its way down into the Italian Peninsula were they established the Villanovan culture...

There is no such thing as ancient Mediterranean Indo-European anything... you're talking about a region and not an actual demographic. Celto-Italic is the ancient language group which eventually separated into two distinct branches. 

Hallstatt Celts were preceded by the Urnfield culture and Unetice culture, which were preceded by the Bell Beakers. 

The Mediterranean population of southern Italy is not derived from the Romans, and there are studies on the genetics of modern Italians.",6.4
Gladiator,"​ @In-Gall_Tegidda_n_Tesemt  I'm Italian and have lived in Italy and can tell you that you are wrong. Northern Italians have predominantly germanic and celtic phenotypes (blond hair and blue eyes) whereas Romans are shorter with a more varied appearance that can range from swarthy brown olive skin tone to light eyes and skin with chestnut hair, but still rarely blond and blue eyed. These traits are also to be found in Southern Italian and Greek populations. Heck, even the Roman historians and Caesar described the Gauls and Germanic tribes as distinctly different from the Romans, being taller with much paler skin. Why must you lie and make history up? To suit your prejudiced narrative?",6.4

Furthermore, what I find really reassuring is that several reviews I’ve read, state that Denzel steels the show. One of the film critics, is the one and only Mark Kermode!

Gladiator,"We're likely in the period following Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, with the main character presented as the son of the gladiator Maximus. This places the story within the ""Severan Dynasty."" Historically, it is entirely possible that the Roman Empire, particularly in Rome, had many African descendants in high-ranking positions. One of the five emperors of this turbulent time, Septimius Severus, was the son of an Italian woman and an African man, a knight from Leptis Magna in Africa.

Under Severus’ reign, there was a significant presence of Africans, Libyans, Syrians, and Black Africans. Therefore, it is quite plausible that someone of African descent could have held a position such as ""Ludi Magni"" (Games Organizer). I’m not at all surprised by this representation.


It's important to note that there were indeed naval battles held in the Colosseum in Rome during that era, known as ""naumachiae."" The Romans had invented a system with wooden floors that could be lifted. They would fill the arena with water and simulate large naval battles, which often ended in bloodbaths. Then, using pulleys, the wooden floor would be lowered, the water drained, and gladiatorial combat—either between the fighters or against wild beasts—would take place.  The big doubt, though, is how, as shown in the trailer, they could fill the Colosseum with sharks?  That seems quite improbable and has never been mentioned in historical records. Then again, the Romans were so ingenious, you never know with them.",6.4

Gladiator," @user-bj5ys4wn3s  why do people bash anything new that comes out lately, even if it looks pretty good?",6.4
Gladiator," @user-bj5ys4wn3s  well... from my point of view - too many historical inaccuracies. Riding a rhino? Really? The first Gladiator wasn't documentary also, but it was pretty grounded. This looks like some Disney Marvel crap in ancient Rome.",6.4
Gladiator," @vpower3187  Why ?  Because it is Not New, but a bad copy of the original Gladiator !",6.4
Gladiator,"​ @TeacherTom1  optimism is the key to coping, coping, is the key to in sanity",6.4

Gladiator,"This is EMBARRASSINGLY bad. What were they thinking ?
We know...🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑😜🤮",6.4
Gladiator,"Because an Australian accent sounds quite like a cocney accent (much similar to British English), which the old Hollywood classics used to have. Now, with an American New York accent, the difference is too noticeable.",6.4
Gladiator,"Mr Scotty go and make a movie of 'The Golden Calf' ! It's easy, simply base it on your own life !",6.4
Gladiator,"All the idiots on here saying the original was perfect and this sequel should never have been made are plain and simply wrong. Gladiator was a great film but it barely scratched the surface of the source material, with a couple of tigers and some dudes with spears stabbing each other. Historical sources suggest the Colloseum was flooded and filled with crocodiles and sinking islands and hosted naval battles, and the volume and variety of animals included in the Games was truly mindboggling. That they've finally decided to make a film that taps into this spectacle is something to be excited about. I've not seen it yet but early reviews are encouraging. Scott is a legend, regardless of what he does now and forever.",6.4
Gladiator,"Riding a rhino?  Yeah, right.  And where is Woopie Goldberg as the emperor's mother?  This tripe makes 'Braveheart' look like a real-life documentary.",6.4
Gladiator,"""I will never be your intrument"" - proceeds to be his instrument.",6.4
Gladiator,"Hubo rinocerontes en el coliseo? sí, los hubo. Hubo rinocerontes con jinete? por supuesto que no!!! Ridley se queja de las películas de marvel y después nos hace ésto. Y después mete encima tiburones. Venga pon a Hulk también.",6.4
Gladiator,"I can hear it now...""King Ceaser Ain't Got Nuthin On Me"".",6.4
Gladiator,"Ridley Scott turns 87 tomorrow. My father, whom I love dearly, is two years younger and spends his day walking the dog and forgetting names. Scott still fires out massive epics with thousands of actors each year. He must be either a robot or a Dunedain.",6.4
Gladiator,"Ridley Scott failed to do anything with Prometheus 2, all we got was scary Muppets running around.",6.4
Gladiator,This trailer is so long that is almost the entire movie.,6.4
Gladiator,"I saw the thumbnail and thought this was some sort of parody of the film... but no, it's the real trailer. What a joke.",6.4
Gladiator,"After watching this, I will stick with the original film, thanks.",6.4
Gladiator,"Mr. Pascal fought against narcos, zombies and Romans, now he’s fighting an ape?😵‍💫",6.4

King ceaser ain't Nutting on Me",6.4
Gladiator,I don't  care which  the best  1 or 2 films  . Important  the cinema is open.,6.4
Gladiator,"I wouldn't say I like it. The first was more real, this one looks a comedy.",6.4
Gladiator,Dam this still looks it’s going to bomb so hard. Some films don’t need to be made and this is one of them,6.4
Gladiator,Watched it over the weekend and found it very weak.  Soundtrack & music was poor and I was dissapointed in the entire thing.  Sorry to have spent the money :(,6.4
Gladiator,I don't care what all the critics say. I think it looks amazing and I can't wait to see it.,6.4
Gladiator,John Wick makes a brief appearance on a rhino with his optional twin crossbows taking out the roman mafia but he has to deal with Denzel the equilizer.,6.4
Gladiator,I simply couldn't finish watching. How on earth was the movie allowed to exist I have no idea.,6.4
Gladiator,most new movies are thresh compared to the masterpieces we had few decades ago,6.4
Gladiator,Looks very promising.. Looking forward to going to the movies 🍿 🎥 to see it..,6.4
Gladiator,I think this looks really good. It is out in cinemas now?,6.4
Gladiator,This movie is going to be TOP TIER 💯🎥🎥let’s gooo . All these people don’t have any money to go see it so they are complaining about it 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅,6.4
Gladiator,No amount of CGI can hide the essential emptiness that is at the core of Hollywood.,6.4
Gladiator,Only one only one main cast could have turned this film into epic,6.4
Gladiator,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. in any case, the Mandalorian will prevail...This is the Way.",6.4
Gladiator,"I am not a fan of sequels but as someone who's age means I am nearer to the exit door of life than  the entrance, I have witnessed that the younger generation often have never seen the original movie or listened to an original recording artist sing a song, so this is oftern the first time for them, they are untainted by the past. Let them just enjoy it for what it is, for what it was only ever meant to be, entertainment, an hour or so of escape from the world.",6.4
Gladiator,The biggest issue is that this crap will make millions  and the Hollywood brain dead society will tell that they can make still good movies....,6.4
Gladiator,Why not have another film about the days of the gladiators? WE dont really have many. The show Spartacus was amazing and so was the first gladiator.,6.4
Gladiator,Mescal kills Denzel at the end. Cuts his hand off then kills him.,6.4
Gladiator,"Surprised this hasn't been released straight to HBO/MAX Streaming since that's the direction their moving to and eventually, the theatres go under",6.4
Gladiator,The first Gladiator was so good because they used real animals in the arena. (Among other things.),6.4
Gladiator,"I probably will not be watching this upcoming sequel, because Gladiator never needed a sequel, and just like Indiana Jones, which it should never have gotten past after The Last Crusade",6.4
Gladiator,"Hi, the CGI looks better in modern video games than in this movie",6.4
Gladiator,I'll wait for gladiator 4 to fill in all the gaps before i watch it.,6.4
Gladiator,"If story and screenplay is good, then this movie also gonna legendary one",6.4
Gladiator,The monkeys look like the ones from Hunger Games. Is it Hunger Games for adults?,6.4
Gladiator,waiting for  'the good the bad and the ugly'  sequel   after seeing this.,6.4
Gladiator,Going to watch this only to see a ship battle in the Colosseum.,6.4
Gladiator,"Ridley got his rhino 😀
I’d go to the cinema to watch this 👍",6.4
Gladiator,Great movie and very entertaint. Using sharks in the Colliseum was breathtaking. Excellent film! 🎉🎉🎉,6.4
Gladiator,"the movie tell the story more than 2000 years ago, the Actors  Acting 2000 Years Later",6.4
Gladiator,"This is like lord of the rings
Why wait 25 years to make a sequel?",6.4
Gladiator,"I feel like Hollywood would be wise to spend money on a survey asking the fans of the first film if a sequel movie is needed, lol. First the Joker 2 movie and now this.",6.4
Gladiator,"A period film with an R n' B track on the trailer, re-used dialogue that references the original in the cheesiest way possible, and magical space baboons - looks promising.",6.4
Gladiator,"Really gotta add that hip hop in there. I love hip hop, but wtf mate?",6.4
Gladiator,"Also nach dem Trailer werde ich mir dieses historische Volldesaster auf keinen Fall anschauen. 
Der absolute Gipfel der Volksverarschung sind für mich die haie im kolloseum.......",6.4
Gladiator,Yes! But the sequel  is suppose to be better? Is it? Good question?😮,6.4
Gladiator,I think this can be good if you don't think of it as a sequel to the Gladiator movie but more as a stand alone ancient Rome type of movie.,6.4
Gladiator,"Its good, but if the First Gladiator had been as this dramatical, without a touching story line, we would never have kept on speaking about it so much.",6.4
Gladiator,I was upset when they made a second one….. then I saw it and was like nvm! Master piece of a movie!! gladitor 2 is awesome!!!!,6.4
Gladiator,"Denzil  is an amazing actor,but the first was the masterpiece  maybe it should have been kept that way.",6.4
Gladiator,This could be good. The Cg on the rhino looks better than the earlier trailers. I just wish movie still looked like film and not shot on clean digital cameras where it just doesnt have a cinematic feel IMO. This movie could be good. I dont think it deserves the hate its getting. This movie doesnt negate anything about the first movie. I hope its hard R,6.4
Gladiator,"People People People chill 😎 enjoy life.. if you don't like sequel its fine but some of us we like  intertainment, if its not based on actual events doesn't change a thing.",6.4
Gladiator,"do you think movies from the future will make movies about the 20th century , hand held video game , war with drones and sir planes , what we think aliens look early internet social media tiktok era lol etc?",6.4
Gladiator,Im watching this movie tomorrow on Friday at the theater. It better not be a waste of 3 hours like Joker 2.,6.4
Gladiator,"Yes , not as good as the original , but still you could watch the movie. I can't even watch the trailers with this one.",6.4
Gladiator,"If this sequel features the two co-emperors Caraculla and Geta (sons of Septimus Severus) then it depicts the beginning of the end of the Roman Empire. Although Rome continued for another two centuries, the betrayal, incest, corruption, murder, and greed for power was unmatched and began the decline of the empire. This I have got to see.",6.4
Gladiator,"I mean, Jesus Christ, the director seems to have missed the point of his own first movie...
The Gladiator was never about the spectacle.",6.4
Gladiator,"So... this is how you need to watch this movie for maximum enjoyment... this is just cool movie with Denzel Wachinton that is slightly inspired on life in ancient Rome but that has upfront no intention of being historically accurate in any sense, for all i know they could be shooting at eachother with blasters.",6.4
Gladiator,I think everyone just needs to give it a chance. It might be damn good.,6.4
Gladiator,I swear the thumbnail made me think it was a spoof trailer.,6.4
Gladiator,"Decidi ver gladiador en el cine sin saber nada de esa película, no habia publicidad previa a las películas, al verla sali del cine convencido que hice la mejor inversión de mi vida al comprar ese boleto, y hasta ka fecha la puedo ver sin dejar de emocionarme después de haberla visto mas de 50 veces.  Es imposible que eso se pueda superar. Pero obviamente vere esta segunda parte, haber que emoción me puede generar.",6.4
Gladiator,"My guess, it wont be as good as the first but it will still be a good watch. And who doesnt like Denzel Washington? Although im not so sure this is his role...",6.4
Gladiator,"Once again, I am convinced that cinematograv has died for me.",6.4
Gladiator,Some movies are better without a sequel. Gladiator was once in a lifetime movie. Not worthy a sequel 😢,6.4
Gladiator,"Not sure of the negative comments 
This looks pretty dam good sometimes second films you need to forget the 1st one for 3hrs 😮",6.4
Gladiator,"its gonna be hard to overdue the first movie ,etched in all men's minds. but it looks good",6.4
Gladiator,"🔍 ""Rewind to 2:05—that example was so relatable! Who agrees? ✋👇""",6.4
Gladiator,"I dont get this anymore, is this a movie cinema, a series, a project in making...what is this gladiator 2 mannn!",6.4
Gladiator,"If I could start a petition to ask them to cancel this, I definitely would. There's just too much disrespect for the fans of Gladiator.",6.4
Gladiator,The sharpness of the image is insufferable. Was this shot on an iPhone?,6.4
Gladiator,"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Some people act like they wrote *Gladiator*! If you didn’t like the movie, just move on—why act like you own the original? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 People have forgotten that cinema, even if it’s based on real events, has always been about creating fiction to entertain. Someone even said, ""2000: Gladiator, 2024: American Gladiator."" Look, when it comes to cinema, American films have inspired the world, much like Japanese anime has. And let’s not forget, even a lot of Japanese anime was inspired by American movies in the first place.",6.4
Gladiator,"Yet its made by the same man who made the original,,I'd agree with you if someone else directed but it's Scott's idea his choice",6.4
Gladiator,A movie set in the Roman Empire should never had a silly rap soundtrack. Makes no sense,6.4
Gladiator,wowwwwwwwwwwwwww what a trailor and what a movie with these actors,6.4
Gladiator,"so many epic stories in history that could be made into a movie awesome like Gladiator, Braveheart or Kingdom of heaven, and they just flush money like this  ..... Gladiator 2 = Titanic 2",6.4
Gladiator,"Wo immer ich war, herrschte Dunkelheit und Finsternis - Rom ist das Licht.",6.4
Gladiator,This one is like Bronnie trying to beat dad on a 1v1,6.4
Gladiator,Looks like I'll be running my legs broken for Denzel now,6.4
Gladiator,"This is how you screw up a movie. You make a sequel that has to live up to the greatness of the first. It never lives up to the original, because the original was peak greatness. Can't make a better movie.",6.4
Gladiator,"J'attends le 3 , le 4 et le 5 avec impatience ! 😎😎😎",6.4
Gladiator,# 1 was Troy 2nd  Gladiator 3rd Alexander 4th Gladiator ||,6.4
Gladiator,"Anybody that's trying to be a critic you're wasting your time, the movie has not even came out yet tell me how you can judge",6.4
Gladiator,"The only thing that can be said, and should be said, is WHY?",6.4
Gladiator,"A "" leave the brain at home "" movie.  Forget historical accuracies, you're in the relm of Conan the Barbarian & Barbarella with this one.  Enjoy ....",6.4
Gladiator,The original Gladiator had men in it that looked like gladiators .,6.4
Gladiator,"Going buy the way things are headed, the next one should be called Gladiator 300 :)",6.4
Gladiator,denzel kind of threw me off.. they should of used unknown talent for that role! it really would have sold!,6.4
Gladiator,First time a trailer convinced me not see a spin off,6.4
Gladiator,"The name was a big mistake. Should have just used the protagonists name followed by ""A Gladiator Saga"" or something. ""Part 2"" is lazy and off-putting",6.4
Gladiator,Not half as good as the first one very disappointing 😢,6.4
Gladiator,Although the Gladiator was a classic but this part 2 also look interesting n appealing. Waiting to watch it.,6.4
Gladiator,the set for teh aqua theater is literally taken from the series ....Those about to die ...its like they thought why put it to waste and make gladiator 2,6.4
Gladiator,I hate that they didnt say ridley Scott made this. People are hating not even knowing its a true sequel,6.4
Gladiator,"There are many historical mistakes in this movie. First, Romans did not ride rhinoceroses but velociraptors. Second, the sharks in the Colosseum are too small. Romans used megalodons. Third, Macrinus was not a black American but an Andaman islander admixed with an Eskimo. Fourth, the most popular entertainment of that time was the clash of gladiators with Godzilla.",6.4
Gladiator,"This is, SPARTA!! Sorry, wrong movie. Are you not entertained??? There we go. This movie is going to be 🔥",6.4
Gladiator,"I'm such a fan of ancient Rome and history, and of the 1st movie, I will probably see it at some point. But I Don't know that I will tell anyone that I did",6.4
Gladiator,Been waiting a long time to see the sequel to Jumanji.  And Planet of the Apes.  And the Equaliser.,6.4
Gladiator,"Terrible decision to make the second one just some money grab the first movie you can make a argument one of the top 10 films of all time question, would you make a second Casablanca?",6.4
Gladiator,If I'm not mistaken you're being sarcastic. Pretty mean to try and spoil other people's funjoyment of perhaps one of the greatest HISTORICAL movies EVER MADE!!!,6.4
Gladiator,"Err, there is no way this will live up to Gladiator. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen - acting, script, photography, music. The cast was full of heavy hitters like Russell Crowe, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Joaquin Phoenix, and Derek Jacobi. Now they're making Lucius to be Maximus' son. That's bullshit. This is likely to tank.",6.4
Gladiator,"Denzel made this movie attractive...Ape like creatures look good, overall interesting 🎉",6.4
Gladiator,Nice but probably a little too much CG!  They could have toned it down a bit to fit reality a little bit more.....,6.4
Gladiator,"Storyline is lame 
Should have let sleeping dogs lie
Now it’s going to catch flees
Thumbs down for me",6.4
Gladiator,"De solo ver este trailer uno se da cuenta que será algo totalmente alejado de la realidad histórica, como suelen hacerlo en Hollywood",6.4
Gladiator,why #2 has the same lines as #1? is this a remake or something?,6.4
Gladiator,Just watched gladiator 2.what a disappointing film. From zombie monkeys. Pet rhinos. To sharks in the coliseum 😢,6.4
Gladiator,The gladiator is only one .This is another epic movie .It seems interesing. Both of them  are inspired from Spartacus,6.4
Gladiator,WHY OH WHY do they insist on giving away so much of the story in the trailer. There'll be very little to be seen that we've not seen already in these trailers. Which I imagine are the best parts to see anyway.,6.4
Gladiator,Gladiator 2 - One of the worst films I've watched. Absolute insult to the original.,6.4
Gladiator,They picked him to play Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic 4. Talking about bad choice.,6.4
Gladiator,The first one is a top film that didn’t need a so called sequel.. this is nothing close to the original so why use the name just call it something else..,6.4
Gladiator,"I will watch the sequel, but Im not impressed by the casting. The lead role lacks the on screen charisma of Russel crow, and who could replace Joaquin pheonix",6.4
Gladiator,"Been in the movie for 30 minutes, watching the fight with the monkeys, this movie is a total joke and the Gladiator name should be removed from the title asap. Bad actors, bad acting, clowny costumes, the story is crap, etc...etc..., a total failure. Can´t believe they did this to Gladiator. Hollyweird.",6.4
Gladiator,Stirrups used when riding horses?    Stirrups didn’t come into use until about 600 A.D./C.E.  About four hundred years after the time period of this movie?,6.4
Gladiator,Why is this happening?? Gladiator is amazing and is a perfect stand alone film it doesn’t need another film,6.4
Gladiator,"don't fix what ain't broken. G1 was epic, doesn't need a sequel. Should have done a film about Circus Maximus. Missed a trick there RS.",6.4
Gladiator,"Just rerelease the original, put it in IMAX.  Better than anything in the past five years.  T2 too.",6.4
Gladiator,The movie looks like it has potential. I just don’t understand why they would cast a guy from Chile to be a Roman???,6.4
Gladiator,"It would be good movie if they named it anything but Gladiator. 
Leave old movies alone, or at least be faithful to the idea, tell me what Denzel has to do here? I am sure his role isn't being sold when he was young.",6.4
Gladiator,A shitty movie.....the first movie remains a legend and cannot be equaled!,6.4
Gladiator,the first one is way better. this seems more like a remake not a new store,6.4
Gladiator,A black leader  in ancient rome?? Hollywood and wokes really screwed it up the gladiator legacy,6.4
Gladiator,"Wow people need to get a grip.  It’s just a good action film for are viewing pleasure nothing to do with history just a good film if you don’t like it, don’t go, but they will be millions who do",6.4
Gladiator,Indeed those two are irreplaceable. And everyone in Gladiator 2 will look like bad copies !,6.4
Gladiator,"it says in google that they came into use in the 2nd century, CE.",6.4
Gladiator,"@    Wikipedia:   “The stirrup was invented in the Chinese Jin dynasty during the 4th century, was in common use throughout China by the 5th century, and was spread across Eurasia to Europe through the nomadic peoples of Central Eurasia by the 7th or 8th century.”",6.4
Gladiator,"Referencing your ""woke"" comment about ""black Roman soldiers,""  Rome had several Emperors from Africa. For example, Marcus Opelius Macrinus and Lucius Septimius Severus. Lucius was one of Rome's greatest emperors. He began as a senator (confirmed to the Senate by Emperor Marcus Aurelius). He was a general and a governor before becoming emperor. He was a warrior emperor, and died in Britain in 211CE waging military campaigns to subdue the Britons and Scots in what was then called Caledonia.He established the original boundary of Londinium (London). When emperor Commodus died (he's in the film), it was Lucius that became the next emperor!

 Also, Rome was almost destroyed during the Punic wars by Carthage, an African city state. A Carthaginian army killed an estimated 70,000 Romans at the Battle of Cannae, 216BCE. And surely you've heard about Hannibal crossing the Alps (with elephants) to attack Rome from the north? Finally, Rome used African soldiers in its legions, especially African cavalry as shock troops! It's too bad this history is still unknown to most Americans. Google: Lucius Septimius Severus to see an image from Roman times of him, his wife Empress Julia Domna (born in modern day Syria). It's NOT ""woke,"" it's untold history! So much of modern American politics is an illusion that has no basis in historical facts.",6.4
Gladiator,Gladiator 2 is great but the 1st gladiator Russel Crowe is legend,6.4
Gladiator,"Can’t wait for Casablanca II to come out, or Son of Citizen Kane.",6.4
Gladiator,Is this a joke? Apes? rhinos? sharks and water inside the arena? im canceling my ticket cinema. i though this was going to be an adult movie...,6.4
Gladiator,Denzel Washington really..🙄🙄. Djimon Hounsou or Ving  Rhames would be way better fit for this role than Denzel.,6.4
Gladiator,No need to touch a masterpiece. I can see already some forced acting. It’s impossible to replicate Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix’s presence and delivery from the original.,6.4
Gladiator,"Why does every movie and series now have to involve Pedro Pascal are there no other actors anymore? This should have been ""Rome"" or something like it not a forced sequel to one of the best movies ever.",6.4
Gladiator,"They shouldn't have done thus one.
There's no need, Maximus died😢😢😢😢😢😢😊",6.4
Gladiator,"I am honestly enough with the first one , I watched it 10 times  😊😊😊😊no hard feelings though.",6.4
Gladiator,I reckon the new Anne Boleyn could beat the new Gladiator,6.4
Gladiator,"Ridley Scott has lost it. He made a mess of Napoleon, and now he is on a mission to destroy his earlier good film as well!",6.4
Gladiator,I went to a theater yesterday. Waste of money. What a fucked up sequel….,6.4
Gladiator,"Should have left it to WWE Studios to remake:
After his territory is conquered by the tyrannical promoter who now leads Sports Entertainment, Lucius is forced to enter the Colosseum and must look to his past to find strength to return the glory of Pro-Wrestling to its people.
After Lucius savagely defeats a mid-card baboon, impressing the stable master Vince K Macrinus, who promises Lucius an opportunity for title shot against The Acacius if he wins enough house shows.",6.4
Gladiator,"I hope ...............
we can C Russell Crowe again

atleast as a Guest apperiance",6.4
Gladiator,Withe Colosseum flooded maybe they can resurface the Titanic and make two sequels into one.,6.4
Gladiator,The only good things in this movie appears to be Pedro Pascal and Denzel. Hope they do at least 50 percent justice to the original.,6.4
Gladiator,Honestly I thought it was a hoax or parody at first. That bad.,6.4
Gladiator,"What's up with the criticisms of Denzel playing a Roman nobleman? So what? Caucasian actors have played the roles of Native Americans, Asians, ancient Egyptians, etc in film and TV for decades!  What about Alec Guiness (an English actor) playing the Arabian Prince Faisal in Lawrence of Arabia? Or the Russian actor Yul Brynner playing Ramses II in The Ten Commandments? And besides, emperors Marcus Opelius Macrinus and Lucius Septimius Severus were from the African continent. Too bad some people want to project modern conceptions of race on the ancient Mediterranean world. It's the affliction of presentism at work. Do some research.",6.4
Gladiator,Ridley Scott hasn’t made a great movie in awhile in my opinion so I hope this one is better,6.4
Gladiator,I could watch it...a sequel that failed is better than a sequel that never wa becauseall are still worshipping the original...,6.4
Gladiator,Genny Savastano should have been the lead. And if Sollima directed at least it would look good.,6.4
Gladiator,"I guess it could be worse...it could have The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black in it",6.4
Gladiator,Yes I’m in this movie as well in the fighting scene with all amor on ! First one on the left when standing there getti g ready to fight against the main character,6.4
Gladiator,"So  many AI-augmented reality scenes.  However, if this is about Denzel Washington, it got to be a great movie.",6.4
Gladiator,Your comments are suspicious. Sequels are made all the time. And your comments about Denzel are hilarious..,6.4
Gladiator,There's the original movie & The Spartacus Triology that'll do for me,6.4
Gladiator,The thing about making a sequel to a masterpiece is that it has to be pretty damn good because it's going to be compared to the original movie. This isn't looking anywhere close especially when you add something that wasn't in the 1st movie like Lucius being Maximus' son. Supposedly this is to make Lucius a chip off the old block. This is a stupid plot ploy and IMO what should have been beneath Ridley Scott but apparently it wasn't. Sad.,6.4
Gladiator,"...and perhaps Gladiator 3 is going to be about Björn Ironside (""Vikings"") going to Rome after all thanks to a rift in time made possible by a spell cast by the Goddess whose Avalon did not entirely fade into the mists in exchange for changing history through a Viking invasion of Rome impeding it from ever conquering Britain....etcetcetc",6.4
Gladiator,"Help Africa, it's time to deep dive on our side of the story",6.4
Gladiator,"The leading actor is absolutely terrible, both his face and his physique are a disgrace. Hollywood is getting worse every year. This movie is unwatchable and disappointing.",6.4
Gladiator,Can anyone explain why the special effects in 2024 are worse than they were back in 1999?,6.4
Gladiator,The 21st century ushered in the age of bad movie making. Glad the original Gladiator sneaked in,6.4
Gladiator,"It's Redicilous, this movie is not according to real  history and will destroy the good memories of  Excellent movie in 2000,",6.4
Gladiator,"Don't tell me at the finish of adhefetious, Denzel will fight against Lucio 😑😑😑😑",6.4
Gladiator,This movie is more inclusive because now there's an afro actor in a main role and this make this movie a better movie 😂,6.4
Gladiator,"I was surprised. looks like it has no / chaotic story. They should of stasrted with a whole new and different story. Not a sequal. Surprised. Ridley is the greatest director alive today, IMHO. this may be his first true bomb.",6.4
Gladiator,"Not only it looks like shyte,  they pretty much showed the entire movie.",6.4
Gladiator,"Jeez, get a grip.  Sword & Sandle epics a film staple since Silent era, good and bad!  Try Bible epics like ""SPQR"", Kirk Douglas' ""Spartacus"", HBO's ""Rome"" or learn about era from Mary Beard's smart documentaries.  Strength & Honor!",6.4
Gladiator,Oh no . . .the bean counters abducted Ridley Scott and forced him to make a sequel . . .,6.4
Gladiator,"This one I will NOT go to see it. Gladiator was great movie no need to spoil it, Just like I won't bother to watch HEAT 2. Also great movie which will be spoiled by sequel",6.4
Gladiator,"So why will they go and choose Denzel to be in a roman film? And then add a gangster song in the trailer, last time I checked it's not April fool's!",6.4
Gladiator,"Trilers are soo good, but they are spoilers in some way, i think i saw all the movie with this.. btw VFX are so good here!",6.4
Gladiator,ngl all yall bugging im looking forward to watch this for free tho,6.4
Gladiator,Who is he meant to be. Loved Gladiator 1 not so sure about this. Don't like special effects. Is it worth going to see????,6.4
Gladiator,"I couldn't continue the movie to honor the original, so disappointed",6.4
Gladiator,Ridley was a true Master with his earlier Movies - but know he is only interested in making MONEY !,6.4
Gladiator,"This movie was made for 14 years old audiences… wtf!!!!!!🤬 😢, my last hope is that the trailer was made really bad, I’m just hoping!psss Ridley you just ruined your entire career, and you deserve it honestly!",6.4
Gladiator,"More famous actor in a supporting role = RED FLAG
Gladdiators fighting against some ape monsters = RED FLAG
Riding a rhino = RED FLAG
Portraying villains as complete imbeciles = RED FLAG
Mimiking the original Gladiator drama with dying beloved = RED FLAG

Well...",6.4
Gladiator,"This Hip Hop Music, Zombie-Monkeys, GCI from hell ... wtf why? Dont destroy every epic movie HOLLYWOOD!",6.4
Gladiator,What the hell is an Irish guy doing as a gladiator?? Even has a thick Dublin accent,6.4
Gladiator,"Remakes, Sequels 1, 2, 3 etc etc. Imagination and creativity left HW long ago. In fact they are milking a brain dead population over and over again",6.4
Gladiator,Why have they made this movie🙄🙄 they shud of just left it alone. The first was the best and the last,6.4
Gladiator,Ok so Hollywood is about to fuck up another glorious epic. Who is surprised?,6.4
Gladiator,I’m going to watch this movie but I’m going to despise every wake moment in it,6.4
Gladiator,"if you want to watch this movie, read these tips (no big spoilers)
- NEVER expect it to be better or equal to the greatest movie ever, Gladiator I
- Considering the absolute dogshit that Hollywood is feeding us the last years, this is a humble pearl
- Dont be bothered to Google any events or animals you see, it is by far not Historically accurate (understatement)
- The monkeys in the Collosseum are zombie monkeys that have the worst CGI i've ever seen for a franchise this big
- Dont expect the same screenplay from the main actor compared to Russel Crowe",6.4

Gladiator,"I would just like to comment on the role played by Denzel Washington. He plays the role of an emperor of Moorish origin. The Moors are the ancestors of the Amazigh, the current inhabitants of North Africa or what is known as the Maghreb. We, as Amazigh, our ancestors were not people of… Black skin, this is a theft of the history of the indigenous people of North Africa, the Amazighs. I have respect for Africans, but it is not right to attribute the history of our ancestors to black Africa.",6.4

It looks like unintentional parody; 
This movie could be for 'Gladiator' what 'Meet my Spartans' was for '300' 
just less funny

I hope Im wrong tho  :(",6.4

Gladiator,"Only from seeing the trailer i can already tell this whole movie is just a hollow shell. Script is like someone mention earlier, written on a lunchbreak.

The art of cinematic is deteriorating and it shows with each film being released today. A handful few have an actual story to tell.",6.4

Gladiator,"Referencing your ""woke"" comment about ""black Roman soldiers,""  Rome had several Emperors from Africa. For example, Marcus Opelius Macrinus and Lucius Septimius Severus. Lucius was one of Rome's greatest emperors. He began as a senator (confirmed to the Senate by Emperor Marcus Aurelius). He was a general and a governor before becoming emperor. He was a warrior emperor, and died in Britain in 211CE waging military campaigns to subdue the Britons and Scots in what was then called Caledonia.He established the original boundary of Londinium (London). When emperor Commodus died (he's in the film), it was Lucius that became the next emperor!

 Also, Rome was almost destroyed during the Punic wars by Carthage, an African city state. A Carthaginian army killed an estimated 70,000 Romans at the Battle of Cannae, 216BCE. And surely you've heard about Hannibal crossing the Alps (with elephants) to attack Rome from the north? Finally, Rome used African soldiers in its legions, especially African cavalry as shock troops! It's too bad this history is still unknown to most Americans. Google: Lucius Septimius Severus to see an image from Roman times of him, his wife Empress Julia Domna (born in modern day Syria). It's NOT ""woke,"" it's untold history! So much of modern American politics is an illusion that has no basis in historical facts.",6.4

Gladiator,"This looks absolutely horrible. It doesn’t even make sense with the fantastical elements in it. Friggin’ monkeys and all.

This seems to be the problem: writers and directors thinking we need more because we’ve seen it all. More effects, more this, more that. First and foremost we want a good story with layered characters. We don’t need CGI fest, which honestly looked better in the first film because it was invisible.",6.4
Gladiator,"i dunno but i hate the color grading, it looks cartoonish and so much obvious CGi happening",6.4
Gladiator,Are they challenging Joker for the worst and most insulting sequel of the year ?,6.4

Gladiator,From Italy: should also fight against extraterrestrials. 😅🤣😂 Gladiatore ? No!!! Americano ohhh si....😂😅😢,6.4
Gladiator,it all feels so forced and the story line so similar. like cant we get something original ?,6.4
Gladiator,"Of course, the II Gladiator does not come close to a perfect work ... the plot in part II builds on part I and stands and falls with this what I personally do not like .... Because it comes like a two-part then, it just doesn't work here. I miss e.g. B. Explanations like: where do two come from so crazy on the throne for so long and how .... There can't have been so many stupid influential people in Rome back then 🤣

The main actor gains something but only something with the film ... the story was idealised ok but these things that had to hold out in part one in part 2 so that the audience is captured (like: honour and strength ... or take the thing with earth in your hand ect) are psychological mechanisms so that you remind the viewer of part 1 and remember and get plus points with it, makes the film seem rather weak, the fight scenes are violent, and effective and in part 1 it was very detailed, every scene said something and stood out, was unreconcesable in part 2 It blurred as an eit spectacle really in memory remained there nothing big, except that I felt sharks abstrusely effectless in the film you saw them and then they didn't really play a big role anymore. Until the beginning, where the first in the water a lot, that came true, but then it was gone again and went down, how much in the movie biting an AI monkey came to me now really ridiculous and appreciative for a fighter, but what the hell .... This remained rather negative in the memory with a -?- what is the purpose of such a thing ... the frequent skimming of the pieces of music from Part 1 Zeitgeist, that the film had bitter neotig and its own good music exceeded the budget? I give 5 out of 10 points

Der II Gladiator kommt natürlich nicht an ein perfektes Werk heran … die Handlung in Teil II  baut auf Teil I auf und steht und fällt mit diesem  was ich persönlich nicht mag …. Weil es wie ein Zweiteiler dann daherkommt das funktioniert hier nur nicht. Mir fehlen z. B. Erklärungen wie :  woher kommen zwei so irre auf den Thron so lange und wie …. Soviel verblödete einflussreiche Menschen kann es in Rom damals nicht gegeben haben 🤣

Der Hauptdarsteller gewinnt etwas aber nur etwas  mit dem Film  …die Story war idealisiert ok aber diese Dinge die in Teil eins in Teil 2 herhalten mussten damit das Publikum eingefangen wird ( wie : Ehre und stärke … oder das Ding mit Erde in die Hand nehmen ect) sind psychologische Mechanismen damit man den Zuschauer an Teil 1 erinnert und Erinnert und Pluspunkte damit bekommt, lässt den Film eher schwach wirken, die Kampfszenen sind heftig, u. effektvoll und bei Teil 1 war es sehr detailliert, jede Szene sagte etwas und ragte heraus, war unerinnerswürdig bei Teil 2 verschwommte es als ein eit Spektakel wirklich in Erinnerung blieb da Nix groß, außer dass ich Haie abstrus effektlos empfand in dem Film man sah sie und dann spielten sie eigentlich keine große Rolle mehr. Bis zum Anfang, wo der erste ins Wasser viel, das wurde wahr, aber dann war es auch schon wieder weg und untergegangen, wie viel in dem Film einen KI-Affen beißen kam mir jetzt wirklich lächerlich und würdigend rüber für einen Kämpfer, aber was soll's .... Das blieb eher negativ in der Gedächtnisse mit einem -?- was so etwas zweckt ... das häufige Abschöpfen der Musikstücke von Teil 1 Zeitgeist, dass der Film bitter neotig hatte und eine eigene gute Musik überstieg Arbeit das Budget? Ich vergebe 5 von 10 Punkten",6.4
Gladiator,"hubieran puesto un mejor actor principal, aunque pueda que lo haga bien, pero para protagonista debe ser un legendario",6.4
Gladiator,Its quite the opposite. Joker 2 was hyped up by everyone and turned out to be a load of crap. And this movie is hated by everyone by trailers and last night was the first screening and literally all the reviews say its phenomenal and lives up to the first movie. So im excited to see it.,6.4
Gladiator,"The movie is good and keeps the attention but they really didn't need that scene where there's sea, sharks and ships in the coliseum arena. That ruined the movie, the laughter. Hahahahahaa.. A mistake that true fans of such movies don't forgive.",6.4
Gladiator,Unnecessary is the only thing that comes to mi mind !!! 😅,6.4

Gladiator,NO. I won't waste my time or money on this shit. Period.,6.4
Gladiator,"I,m surprised Scott has gone this way, its too fancaciful to be anywhere near or close to the original, the casting for me is all wrong, might be ok, when we can watch the full movie but up to now, pales in comparison to Russel and Joaquim",6.4
Gladiator,They really know how to ruin a good movie when is prt 3 coming out tho,6.4
Gladiator,Lead actor just isn't strong enough to carry the role.   Premise of the sequel is not great but its the casting that has really spoiled its appeal.,6.4
Gladiator,Everything in this movies seems great but the actor picked for the role of Maximus the Gladiator. Not the best pick no charisma for such an important role. Wasn't nobody else available?. Maybe Chris Hemsworth would've been the best,6.4
Gladiator,Why make a movie of a already existing great one? The history is vast like do something new...... I'd love to watch a migration period movie,6.4
Gladiator,"There is only 1 Gladiator movie en now there is a Gladiator 2 movie.

The first one was Great, let’s hope the second one is good to.
Movie’s are supposed to be entertainment nothing more. 
More drama in the reactions then in the 2 movies 😂",6.4
Gladiator,Yeah the lead should be a well known actor. Like Jim Carrey or Jack Black.,6.4
Gladiator, @MrStaano Lol. No but you gotta admit Ryan Gosling would elevate this thing to new heights.,6.4
Gladiator, @kambonwilliams701  I agree with you i had the same feeling. That guy might be a cool dude. But we needed a well known star. Indeed Gosling or a Brad Pitt type / level actor.  Jim Carrey that was funny wasnt it? See him do Gladiator 2. :face-blue-smiling: :face-blue-smiling:👍,6.4
Gladiator,Denzel Washington must be thinking .......what the F***k was I thinking putting my name to this stinker. Ridley Scott is past it.,6.4
Gladiator,"What is this, the science fiction version? I thought it was supposed to be Gladiator 2, and I had hopes to be entertained again. Apparently Hollywood has been getting more and more desperate the last few years, and are out of ideas. It seems to me that the movie industry is a slowly dying business. The directors have become incompetent. I rarely watch movies made in the USA anymore; it's a bit sad. Movies from other countries are more interesting.",6.4
Gladiator,I hope to see the murder of emperor Geta in this movie or the next one,6.4
Gladiator,"another cgi fest, I don't care for these anymore, cgi ships crashing and cgi apes fighting, all the digital detail and clean physics, i'd rather see a much more simplified version if the effects were practical.",6.4

Gladiator,Good grief this one is a mess no matter how you looks at it,6.4
Gladiator,"Should have just let the classic from 2000 be, respect the cast but the story looks meh",6.4
Gladiator,"I went to see it in the movies a week ago. As expected and unfortunately it is not even a quarter of what the first movie was with story, acting, score , this is nothing more but an action movie with lots of CGI and some very boring inter-spaces between start and end, I did not even like Denzel and that is rare.",6.4
Gladiator,What about this truth of Cornelius Tacitus about 50.000 dead rome civils who died under stones of stadium in the time of Saturnalies? Constructions of stadium were uncapable. Thats theme of thinking of verses,6.4

Gladiator,"You’re kidding right? You submit that because someone was born in North Africa that makes them black?? Wow, that is rubbish.
I won’t see this movie because I think that’s exactly what they did here and I’m entitled to that. I won’t pay to watch Hollywood change history because they want to appeal to a broader audience by including one of the greatest actors of all time in one of its movies.
Let me know how it was though🤣",6.4
Gladiator," @williamoleary9330   I never used the word ""blacK,"" did I? I said African. Emperors Macrinus and Septimius Severus were from Africa! You can't change that. Africa's great diversity of people, flora and fauna are still part of Africa. The African continent doesn't end at the southern edge of the Sahara. It includes this massive desert and all the northern  places, people and nations along the  Mediterranean (eg Lybia, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt etc). It's all Africa!

 I know it's difficult for many people to conceptualize it this way. especially when it comes to power and Africa's cultural influences on European civilization. It is easy to accept Europe's influences on Africa, but the reverse is very difficult, isn't it? 

After all, weren't the Moors of Arabia and Africa partly responsible for bringing Europe out of the Dark Ages starting around 711CE? It was their math & sciences (suppressed by the Catholic Church) that caused Frankish nobles to send the sons to study in Moorish Spain. Have been visited the southern region of Spain (Andalusia, or Al Andalusia in Arabic)? I have, and the Moors were brilliant (see Seville, Cordoba, Grenada). Read the Book of Sir Roland (circa 718CE), a Frankish warrior who fought against the Moors (Islamic ""Saracens"") in modern-day France. The Moors are described as“Blacker than ink with large noses and ears” and with “nothing white except the teeth.” (Moriaen. Arthurian Romance No. 4, PP. 29, 39, 41, 103. 1907. Trans. by J. L. Watson). The Chanson of Roland states that the Moorish army was 50,000 strong and led by Marganice, Emperor of Ethiopia and Carthage. Their most valiant figure is Abisme (that is, Abyssinian), who (verse 126) is described as “black as melted pitch.” In this epic, the Moors are called Sarrazins, in English, Saracens. This is the oldest surviving example of French literature.
 
Google emperor Lucius Septimius Severus. There's a round image of him with his wife Julia Domna and one son Caracalla (Geta has been erased, possibly after he was murdered by his brother). This image of the royal Roman Severan family is probably the most accurate representation and from Roman times. What do you see?",6.4

Gladiator,"Referencing your ""woke"" comment about ""black Roman soldiers,""  Rome had several Emperors from Africa. For example, Marcus Opelius Macrinus and Lucius Septimius Severus. Lucius was one of Rome's greatest emperors. He began as a senator (confirmed to the Senate by Emperor Marcus Aurelius). He was a general and a governor before becoming emperor. He was a warrior emperor, and died in Britain in 211CE waging military campaigns to subdue the Britons and Scots in what was then called Caledonia.He established the original boundary of Londinium (London). When emperor Commodus died (he's in the film), it was Lucius that became the next emperor!

 Also, Rome was almost destroyed during the Punic wars by Carthage, an African city state. A Carthaginian army killed an estimated 70,000 Romans at the Battle of Cannae, 216BCE. And surely you've heard about Hannibal crossing the Alps (with elephants) to attack Rome from the north? Finally, Rome used African soldiers in its legions, especially African cavalry as shock troops! It's too bad this history is still unknown to most Americans. Google: Lucius Septimius Severus to see an image from Roman times of him, his wife Empress Julia Domna (born in modern day Syria). It's NOT ""woke,"" it's untold history! So much of modern American politics is an illusion that has no basis in historical facts.",6.4
Gladiator,Too many fake scenes made by artificial intelligence which made it looks cheap and stupid.,6.4
Gladiator,bad casting. Enough Denzel Washington....hard pass.And the other guy reminds me of the movie Great Wall. Hard pass.,6.4
Gladiator,"Well then I really like Denzel Washington but making him a Macrinus the leader of the Praetorians who will assassinate Caracalla is pure bullshit. Macrinus is from North Africa and at that time North Africa was populated by Berbers who had mostly dark skin and not black. Black people lived and live in sub-Saharan Africa. It happened that these Berbers crossed the Sahara in order to raid to capture black slaves and take them back to North Africa. Later the Arab-Berber Muslims continued these practices hence the presence today of black populations in the Maghreb. If Macrinus is not a descendant of an Italian who settled in North Africa during the Republican period it is very likely that he descends from local Romanized elites who at one time or another acquired citizenship. It is impossible that he descends from a black slave. Moreover, Roman society was very conservative, and the difference in skin color between a black person and a Roman whether he had light pale skin or light matte (Mediterranean) was too radically different to be accepted.
As for the emperors Caracalla and Geta, they belonged to the Sèvres dynasty originating from Syria, again here it is appropriate to know if this dynasty descends from a family of Italian origin or from a family of Semitic Arab origin. In any case, their skin colors were certainly not light pale but rather matte. Here again we have the example of a cultural wokism that takes no account of historical truth or logic",6.4

Gladiator,"Africa is not a homogeneous continent. North Africa, populated by Mediterranean-type populations, is clearly cut off from black Africa by the largest desert in the world: the Sahara. We cannot therefore say that all of Africa is a black continent. As for the films you mention, the majority of them have not been watched by the general public for a long time. You have to have a little common sense, a little logic so that the public can immerse themselves in the story. We cannot therefore choose, for example, a white actor like in the 50s and 60s to play, for example, the king of an African tribe, or a Chinese or Japanese emperor, whatever the talent of the actor in question, and the reverse is also true. It is a question of maintaining a minimum of coherence, especially when it is a film that deals with a historical period. It is true that for this film the problem does not stop only with the character of Denzel Washington, there is clearly a casting problem whether with Pedro Pascal or Paul Pascal who have an oyster charisma, we are far from Russel Crow in addition Ridley Scott seems to have taken a lot of distance from historical reality (Gladiator had also taken some distance from history but despite all these ""liberties"" seemed credible and was counterbalanced by a powerful script rigor, which does not seem to be the case here). We are witnessing here an excessive Disneylandization, that is to say that nothing matters, we can do everything and its opposite without worrying about coherence and logic. We throw in special effects to excess. It is no longer cinema but a circus, a huge show machine without soul. You have to be devoid of culture and historical knowledge to find nothing wrong with it, maybe this film is aimed primarily at an American viewer.",6.4

Heretic,"The pie candle was right in front of them the entire time. You can see it lit on the table and facing them when he's still in the room. He never hid it from them, he allowed them to be victims of their own willing belief in what they were told when the truth was in front of them. This was his first test, more than just a trap.
I think at every step he will push them to abandon the given information that they want to believe and instead use their minds and senses in the present moment in order to survive, to overcome comforting misinformation and see if they can pursue their best interests in extremity.",7.2

Heretic,Three things: 1) A trailer opening with The Hollies Air that I Breathe will always grab my attention; 2) casting Hugh Grant in a horror film is a stroke of genius; 3) the film generally looks brilliant and gives me future classic vibes,7.2
Heretic,"My son and I saw this film last night and all I can say is wow. This is the reason why I go to the movie theater. Such a fantastic and thought provoking movie. We left with so many questions, but in a good way. We wanted to watch it again as soon it was over because I know we missed a lot. Great story, acting, writing, cinematography, just everything. I was frozen for the first hour. Two thumbs up. A must watch if you’re a true movie buff.",7.2

Heretic,"I watched this trailer a few times now and I feel like I might know what the story is about. I'm just blind guessing but I feel like there are solid hints.

Hugh Grant is the follower of an esoteric and ancient religious practice. Likely, they'll mix it in with general occultism.


In ancient Greece, there was something called the Eleusinian Mysteries. While there's a lot behind them, the short and general of it is they were rituals where a person ingested a psychedelic substance called Kykeon. This is done before the person was then sent into a temple which was a kind of religious maze or labyrinth. It was set up in such a way that the themes and experiences inside the temple reflected the message of the ritual as a whole. You basically would go in, lose your mind on this psychedelic while traversing the ritual themed maze, then emerge as a completely reborn person.

Some described this ritual as being so powerful and so profound that initiates would lose their fear of death entirely because they genuinely believed they experienced God or the afterlife or something extremely divine in nature. 

The Greek style statue that gets revealed when Hugh flips the switch at 1:18 makes me think they're leaning in that direction. The fact the room he's standing in is filled with religious symbols from different faiths (There's a menorah and a Shiva statue on the bookshelves to his right and left at 1:23) - The implication being he studies religion and probably dives into the mystical topics behind each one. Occultism takes inspiration from a lot of religions so the mixture implies something in that direction.


Hugh modeled his house after this labyrinth style temple used during the Eleusinian Mysteries. The girls likely drank a tea or drink which was filled with the psychoactive substance (look at the table at 0:32) and he's about to send them on a journey that will change their lives. 

""It will make your hearts beat faster. It may even make you want to die.""

He's describing the effect of the drink he gave them. The labyrinth he sends them into simply amplifies the fear and hallucinations which drives them further towards the end goal. That goal?

""Do not be afraid. You will witness a miracle.""

He is sending them into this maze to reenact an ancient ritual which forces a person to overcome their fears and gives them a genuine religious experience. He purposely nudges them through the door which leads into the maze by challenging their faith. As religious people, they'll accept the challenge (which is what Hugh wants) while the door which said ""disbelief"" likely led them outside. 

He isn't torturing them for being religious. He knows that the only people who can be granted the right to experience the miracle are those who genuinely do believe. It's all part of the ritual.",7.2
Heretic,I never realized that Hugh Grant would make a great psycho killer,7.2
Heretic,I've never been so happy for an actor to outlive their romcom years. Hugh Grant is a powerhouse and he finally gets to show off his range 👏,7.2
Heretic,All of those years that he was type casted in Romcoms may have paid the bills but this is the type of role that Hugh should be in! Can't wait to see this!,7.2
Heretic,You know it's not gonna end good when some stranger offer you a pie.,7.2

Heretic,"he was always made for being a villain but got thrown into romcoms, glad we can finally see villain Hugh Grant",7.2
Heretic,A lot of people say he's a prick so it suits him,7.2

Heretic,"Too bad Bruce Willis' mental health forced him into retirement.  Hugh Grant would make a great Die Hard villain.  Imagine the exchange of wisecracks between these two and the battle of wits.  With a good script, I think it could have brought the franchise out of the hole it was in.",7.2

Heretic,"Hugh Grant was amazing in “The Undoing”, he plays an incredible villain, definitely his genre",7.2
Heretic,Well he doesn’t like to blow his own trumpet but his work here is divine,7.2
Heretic,"Agree but it is mainly because he is of a generation when actors could 'actually' act by training their voices, bodies and mannerisms  to become a completely different person unlike now they just emote, shout a lot and rely on their looks, explosions, stunt actors and loud music.",7.2

Heretic,"f they did it right, this would make for a great thought-provoking thriller. Do you really believe, and how far will that get you in life? You preach it, but do you practice it?",7.2
Heretic,I think what makes it creepier is that Hugh Grant is in a lot of romantic comedies. And as such we have a more comfortable level of attachment to him. And to see him leave that and become a villain. It gives you chills. That you never really 'know someone... 😁,7.2
Heretic, @jhonshephard921  there is a death to 2021 ? thanks in advance for a great evening friend,7.2

Heretic," @Epoch11 I know people who have met and worked with him. He is fond of ladies, but widely liked.",7.2
Heretic,This... Probably got tied of pretending to be a nice guy.,7.2
Heretic,"Actually I think he has found his role. Kinda like Bryan Cranston said his whole like he tried to be a comic and he is good at it but his calling and what he will forever be known as is Walter White. Think sometimes luck, chance and a bold step outside their boxes lets them do this. Kinda like Bill Murray as well in Lost in Translation..proved he was a master actor not just a goofy funny guy.",7.2
Heretic,"One sister dies the other lives. Hugh Grant is killed with floor board with nails in it.

Movie misrepresents Mormon beliefs and doctrines throughout. The script got leaked to Ward Radio.",7.2
Heretic,"Sorry to burst your bubble.

Hugh dies with a floor board with nails in it to his head.

One sister dies from stab wound from Hugh.

Two old ladies die in the basement.

Both doors lead to the same location.

Tons of anti Mormon tropes.

An old lady dies by eating a blueberry pie and another old lady replaces her.

Want any more spoilers?",7.2
Heretic,"He's a good actor, who understands that good looks don't last and in order to continue acting, you can't cling to youth. You actually have to be good and get better and better at the craft.

Bravo, to him!",7.2
Heretic, @jbone877  Same that movie made me hate his character so much,7.2
Heretic,Has no one in this thread seen his villainous work in the film adaptation of “Cloud Atlas”???,7.2
Heretic,"No

: )



No it fucking isnt 

Actually

Its really fucking sad to see him finally go there

2 b honest",7.2
Heretic,That HBO series where he's accused of murdering his mistress is FANTASTIC. He puts on such a masterclass in that role,7.2
Heretic, @IloveGorgeousGeorge  I still have to see that is that the undoing,7.2
Heretic,"I am totally here for Hugh Grant's villain era too! 😊 
He was brilliant in Wonka and Paddington",7.2
Heretic,I remember when he was just doing roles like a young handsome doctor... 😭,7.2
Heretic, @anabuquerin2202 not the first time. He first played the villain in Atlas Rise and then Paddington 2.,7.2
Heretic,"He's a bad guy in real life, he's even admitted as much. Playing to his natural strengths is much better.",7.2
Heretic,"Agreed. I never liked him before the D&D movie, but he's really won me over.",7.2
Heretic, @jefflebowski3784 I could barely recognise who that low life journalist was. 😂😂😂,7.2
Heretic," @MexicoCityLAMB Me too!  This movie looks very good and tense!  From Fort Worth, Texas😄",7.2

Heretic,"Usually there is something sinister they hide, like farts, but this twist is good too.",7.2
Heretic,Brilliant comment. You should be a writer. Hum..maybe you are. But seriously. I actually laughed right out loud and scared the dog with my outburst.,7.2
Heretic," @stacyg585  Man, I hope most of these people got the whole ""scented candle instead of pie in oven"" thing.",7.2
Heretic,most of them suck but i found a few pumpkin cheesecake ones... it will make u drool..made my house smell like thanksgiving,7.2
Heretic,"One time driving through vermont, I got off of the highway and was immediatey overwhelmed by a heavy scent of an everything perfume. I got an instant headache and then I saw it. The yankee candle company.",7.2
Heretic,I can GUARANTEE  the Blueberry Pie candle did not smell ANYTHING like Blueberry Pie!,7.2
Heretic,Haven’t you ever seen The Dinner Party episode of the Office? 😂,7.2
Heretic,I will never look at a yankee candle store the same again 😂,7.2

Heretic,legit its lemon and myrtle that freaking me out at night,7.2
Heretic,Agreed. I lit a sweet potato pie candle I woke up to.flames my cat knocked it over my everything burned to the ground including mu cat 😢,7.2
Heretic,High grant actually read this comment and mentions it in an interview he did for rotten tomatoes,7.2
Heretic, @radiosant  bless human beings like you for being alive to give us these comments 😆😂,7.2
Heretic,"Do you know that Hugh Grant commented on your comment? 
Look up: The 'Heretic' Cast Breaks Down a Scene From Their New Movie. It's at 5:22 where he references your comment.",7.2
Heretic,Seriously. Not a very good trailer and now I'm less interested than when I went in.,7.2
Heretic,I like to light a cinnamon roll candle in the morning so my husband wakes up with false hope.,7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant talked about your candle comment in a fandango interview,7.2
Heretic,"Hugh Grant actually commented on your comment about scented candles, or another saying essentially the same thing, in an interview. 😅",7.2
Heretic," @radiosant  You take 1st prize. 
An absolutely hysterical comment/ observation. 🤣🤣🤣",7.2
Heretic," @radiosant  I have soooo been looking forward to seeing this Movie, however, shan't now, ( at least for a while), bcoz all I'll be able to think about is your comment !!! Thks for nothing. 🤣🤣🤣",7.2
Heretic, @zstevens7 the fragrance house I worked at put in a bid for that work XD,7.2
Heretic,"Weirdly enough, I think the movie most responsible for this career shift was Paddington 2.",7.2
Heretic,"I’ve only seen him in Dungeons and Dragons and About A Boy, I hear he’s hard to work with tho and I hope he wasn’t for this film.",7.2
Heretic,"@ladyreverie7027  I have no doubt about that, but what I'm saying isn't that he's never played a villain before his role in Paddington 2, but rather that it marked a shift in his career from romantic lead to weirdo character actor. Though, granted, that's something a lot of actors like him seem to sort of evolve into when they reach the age he is now.",7.2
Heretic,It's more like 4 weddings got him stuck in comedies for a while.,7.2
Heretic,"Yesss! After seeing him in Dungeons and Dragons, I was like ""hmm, I think I like Hugh Grant playing a villain"". That's what made me click on this. I think it's cause we're used to seeing him in the charming, good guy role, so it tickles our senses when he turns out to be dangerous.",7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant is a perfect choice for an unsettling horror movie!,7.2
Heretic," @woudgy Yes !  that is the one with him as an actor or director?  i saw it long time ago . Alan Rick
an is in it?",7.2
Heretic,I can't wait to see what he does with this role. This is so against the likeable rom com lead he always plays.,7.2
Heretic,Exactly. I could not stand him until he stopped the RomComs.,7.2
Heretic,"Soooo excited to see Hugh Grant show a lot of ppl who only have seen him play the lovable goofball, what an amazing and truly diverse actor he can be.  I know about a boy isn’t really a serious movie nor does it end up being a love story but I do love that movie! I am beyond thrilled to see him play a villainous role in a horror movie!!! I know he will kill the role too!!!!",7.2
Heretic,Guy Ritchie I think was the man. He put him in a few movies and he took off.,7.2
Heretic," @lilaccilla  yes, it has a pantomime production of Peter Pan as the back story. The star of the movie is really Georgina Cates, but Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant costar, and the latter is wonderfully toxic.",7.2
Heretic,I agree. My favourite thing he's done so far was the actor in Paddington 2. It truly showed his versatility. Then he was cast in The Gentleman oh and then Dungeons & Dragons.,7.2
Heretic,"I think its great to see ""wholesome"" character actors in darker roles, the disconnect makes it even scarier.",7.2
Heretic, @Potpie007  I think that was one of my favorite roles he played,7.2
Heretic,"American moviegoers are already conditioned to think ""British accent"" = ""villain"". Think of all the villains that have been superbly portrayed by British actors - Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, Alan Rickman in the Die Hard movies and Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, Ian McKellen in X-Men, Paul Freeman in Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Christopher Lee, Ralph Fiennes, Jeremy Irons, Terence Stamp, Ian McDiarmid, James Mason. So it's a natural fit even for actors not previously cast as villains.",7.2
Heretic,"He did a wonderful work also in Cloud Atlas, where he plays different kind of villains including a cannibal",7.2
Heretic, @rumblefish9  but lately i think it was guy ritchie who made him comeback? not sure,7.2
Heretic,"Hugh grants picks his roles.  You realize actors are autonomous human beings, right?",7.2
Heretic,"Scott Beck is a joke! Anyone who challenges other beliefs yet hides their own stance of beliefs, life, and morals is not to be taken serious or any or their work. They are more closely related to trolls.",7.2
Heretic,"He was excellent as the sex deprived husband in 'Bitter Moon(1992)'. Not only was this his greatest role, I also think it's the best film ever!",7.2
Heretic,Who would have though that he turned out to be such a fine actor. Glad to see he is offered more versatile roles nowadays.,7.2
Heretic,"When he ""retired"" from acting he just decided to take roles he really loves. Whether that be Paddington 2 or a movie like this. He isn't under the pressure of being a Hollywood leading man anymore. I love it and I live for it.",7.2
Heretic,"Totally…the first movie I saw him in was Four Weddings and a Funeral when I was a teenager and I told myself no more of this nonsense 😂, I’m not at all a romantic comedy person. So I didn’t watch any of his other movies. The second movie of his I watched was Guy Ritchie’s The Gentleman and I was blown away. Hugh was phenomenal in that movie (as was the rest of the cast) and I thought to myself that this guy has wasted a big part of his career in stupid romantic movies while he could have played awesome roles. I love seeing him in edgier roles!",7.2
Heretic, @Stand_By_For_Mind_Control  Agree!. Always liked him in a lighthearte superficial way. Until I saw that role.,7.2
Heretic,"​ @rumblefish9 Never heard of that one, thanks for the recommendation!",7.2
Heretic,Well he aged out of those movies.  If he was still young they'd still be doing it.,7.2
Heretic,Why would you punish someone who thought of such a good idea by kissing them?,7.2
Heretic,"Sounds like it was first time him in a not rom com role, but I remember him in a very different kind of movies",7.2
Heretic,"i have kids, i saw Paddington 2 with mean Hugh Grant 2017; he's excellent.",7.2
Heretic,never expected him as an oopah loopahah now i cant get enough,7.2
Heretic,"He says, 'Do not be afraid!:p  -----------------This to some insecure Zoomers?  Bahahahahhahahahaha",7.2
Heretic," @Stand_By_For_Mind_Control  this is my fave of his, great chemistry between him and Charlie Hunnam",7.2
Heretic,all good actors should go dark and creepy now and again.,7.2
Heretic," @spencermalgam7231  they probably get bored doing the same thing, I would guess.",7.2
Heretic,He makes a better bad guy than romantic interest since he got older.,7.2
Heretic,"Hugh Grant comes off as ""the nice neighbour next door"". That's what makes Mr Reed so insidious.",7.2
Heretic,"he played in extreme measures a suspense movie very good 
he should indeed  try to play more in thrillers/horror",7.2
Heretic,He is too old to play roles like in Notting Hill anyways...has to move on to more challenging stuff...,7.2
Heretic,I did not get this. Why did she know there is no pie just because there is a Candle with a Pie name on it?,7.2
Heretic," @leifhesse  They most likely believed him at first because it smells like a pie is cooking. But there isn't a pie, its a pie scented candle.",7.2
Heretic," @leifhesse  The implication is that they believed him about the pie because they could smell it, but then they realized the scent was artificial. That one lie then calls everything else into question as well. Also possible she got weird vibes, or there were other tells, but we haven't seen the whole movie yet homie.",7.2
Heretic," @leifhesse  Because he claims that his wife is home and that there's a blueberry pie in the oven, which they can smell, so they believe him. She realises the candle is the real source of the smell of blueberry pie: therefore, no real pie smell = no pie = quite possibly no wife. It proves he's tricked them. He's lied to get them inside his home and that means they are no longer safe. Absolutely chilling.",7.2
Heretic," @leifhesse  they had been smelling the blueberry pie while they were there, so it put them at ease that there was a pie in the oven. Just as the man said there was. Then, when they realize the scent is from a candle, and not an actual pie, the brain juices started flowing, and then the pee...",7.2
Heretic,"some times some movies start with two ladies outside the door and then ends with double creampie, this is not such a movie.",7.2
Heretic,"​ @Werewolf914  but for him, getting out of the house is as easy as eating a pie!!!",7.2
Heretic,"That's the worst part of the trailer, he could have a pie candle and a pie in the oven, no one would realistically look shocked and think there isn't actually a pie just because he had a candle of one, at best one would say ""oh look, he must really like pies"" and in the movie I won't be surprised if he does bring out an actual pie for them to eat .",7.2
Heretic,​​ @leifhesse I'm with you. I couldn't figure it out either at first until everyone here explained it. And now I feel dumb.,7.2
Heretic,"​ @leifhesse  Because he mentioned there being a pie in the Iver, they could smell it cooking. But they couldn't it was a candle. There is no pie.",7.2
Heretic," @randelhall3864  The pie is a lie.
Sounds even better.
And there actually was a cake after all.",7.2
Heretic,They had faith that there was a pie baking.  That the smell of a baking pie was actually merely a scented candle challenged their faith.,7.2
Heretic," @leifhesse  It's a short trailer man, you people constantly whine about trailers showing too much and then also complain when you didn't understand something shown in the trailer...",7.2
Heretic, @Ocarina654  He also said his wife was home but then it showed a photo of just him and his dog.,7.2
Heretic," @FrawgfithAmblose  why would you be a person who bakes blueberry pie for real, and also buy a candle that smells like you are baking a pie...",7.2
Heretic,OMG I only just got it because of your comment 😅,7.2
Heretic,​ @leifhesse  Did your generation not learn context clues in school or something? It's pretty straightforward regarding the pie scene on the trailer.,7.2
Heretic," @leifhesse no I didn’t either, I’m from the UK and never had blueberry pie in my life. If it had been apple pie maybe.. scones/toast/pot noodle would have been on it.",7.2
Heretic,"The candle is the source of the pie he claimed his wife is cooking. There’s no pie, and probably there’s no wife as well.  He might turn those women as his wives though",7.2
Heretic,"Don’t worry, there is a pie, he says so when they’re at the doorstep",7.2
Heretic," @leifhesse It's because you're a critical thinker. It didn't click with me at first, as well. Just because a blueberry candle is burning doesn't necessarily mean a blueberry pie isn't in the oven, too.",7.2
Heretic,My fat a££ would just be mad there’s no pie/cake! 😂.,7.2
Heretic," @leifhesse  The full scene probably goes like this: 1) He leaves to check on his homemade blueberry pie, an old family recipe... 2) He's gone for an uncomfortably long time, and the girls talk about how strange he's behaving and other little details... 3) One of the girls decides to leave, but the door is locked... 4) The other girl tries to comfort her friend, says I'm sure he'll be back with the pie any moment... 5) They turn the candle around and read the label. There is no pie. 6) This confirms their suspicions that something's very wrong.",7.2
Heretic,"which is kind of funny, because Mormons are the ones behind Scentsy artificial scented candles....maybe an inside joke from the screenwriters.",7.2
Heretic," @Rojitos Relax. No, it's not. Just because he had a blueberry pie scented candle wouldn't automatically mean he doesn't also have a blueberry pie.",7.2
Heretic, @FrawgfithAmblose Yep. That’s A24. This film is much deeper than what’s shown in the trailer. They always produce the best psychological horror films that make you think.,7.2
Heretic, @kyleh3227  but the candle isnt lit so how does that work?,7.2
Heretic," @leifhesse  i agree, wow it says blueberry pie creepy. the candle isnt lit so they cant smell the pie smell or is the candle that good you can smell it from that far.",7.2
Heretic,"I feel like I’d definitely be able to tell the difference from a candle and a real pie, as would most other people. But I think it’ll have a deeper meaning once we watch the full movie, like something about trust and believing people without proof",7.2
Heretic,I dont even like horror/thrillers and even i gave that 8/10,7.2
Heretic," @FrawgfithAmblose  ""realistically"" sir this is a movie. a fictional one at that",7.2
Heretic," @bryansmith844  That's actually just the blueberries on the label! Though the lighting does make them look like blood spots aha. Could also be a hint? (probaly not, im jus looking into things)",7.2
Heretic,It took me a moment to get it but ironically enough she and I had the same face. She knew but I haven’t quite figured it out as fast. Chilling!,7.2
Heretic,"That's my first thought too. Why the blood on the label?  And the writing on the bottom of the label was too small for me to read but what if that name is the name of his wife and he made her into a blueberry scented candle? That would mean that Hugh Grant told the technical truth when he told the girls that his wife was at home... It's just not in the way the girls thought. And by the time they realize it, it's too late and they're trapped.
I can't wait for this movie to come out! Just the trailer was chilling",7.2
Heretic,"I thought the candle was going to have ""I <3 Satan"" written on it or something 😅",7.2
Heretic,"It feels like the trailer missed the mark on how the whole pie thing was a big deal.  I mean if I was visiting some strangers house and he went to go check on the pie, and then I noticed a pie scented candle, Id just think the guy really likes pies.  My first instinct wouldnt be shock and horror.",7.2
Heretic, @FrawgfithAmblose  Oh there is no way. I would be 100% surprised if he were to bring out an actual pie.,7.2
Heretic, @patrickk1771  lol thanks for that. Now I feel better about their chances.,7.2
Heretic,"I've yet to find a ""pie"" candle that actually smelled like a pie.  That alone should have been a red flag.",7.2
Heretic,Tbh the fact that there was no pie is the scariest most nefarious part,7.2
Heretic,"But the candle isn't lite, so how would there be any scent?",7.2
Heretic, @FrawgfithAmblose  We don’t know what happened leading up to the part. Maybe he disappeared for an hour and then they realized something was up. Maybe they tried to leave and the door was locked then she sees the candle. I’m sure something goes wrong in order for her to panic after looking at the candle.,7.2
Heretic," @hieuluu2  maybe he has ten of them? Maybe they’re all lit in another room. You can deduce that if he owns this candle, he might have others. Maybe it was blown out right before she looks at it and that’s how she notices it. We haven’t seen the whole movie",7.2
Heretic," @gibons9892  In reality it doesn't work like that. The candle  was not lit, if there was a scent, it would be so faint  that you would actually have to sniff the candle for it. Also no candle pie scent smells  like the real aroma of pies actually baking in the oven.",7.2
Heretic,Why leave a tell in front of whoever he’s going to trap. This is not a omg moment. It would take a normal observant person to throw everything off. U could get the same effect with the candle in the other room.,7.2
Heretic,Maybe you'll find yourself in the same situation one day since you love it so much.,7.2
Heretic,"Scott Beck is a joke! Anyone who challenges other beliefs yet hides their own stance of beliefs, life, and morals is not to be taken serious or any or their work. They are more closely related to trolls.",7.2
Heretic,I get a similar feeling after I pay for dinner on a date and realize later that there will be no pie.,7.2
Heretic,​ @Ocarina654 Hahahahah yes because folks mistake candle with pie all the time.,7.2
Heretic,​ @kyleh3227 Hahahahaha really? When was the last time you mistook a candle for a pie?,7.2
Heretic, @DingDongDaddyFromDumas933  it’s a movie. Sometimes you just need to roll with a plot device,7.2
Heretic,Or it could be the title was “Home Aromantics” signifying he is not married nor is interested in romantic relationships. I’m AroAce and I find that funny,7.2
Heretic, @leifhesse  I'd be curious how many women vs men have this question.,7.2
Heretic," @DingDongDaddyFromDumas933  I mean, when it says ""BLUEBERRY PIE SCENT"" that's clearly the intent of the shot. I didn't say whether it was believable or not, because you can't smell a movie, but it's excellent visual shorthand to establish what is happening.",7.2
Heretic,yeah it took me way too many seconds to get it lol,7.2
Heretic," @randelhall3864  This comment was a triumph! I'm making a note here ""HUGE SUCCESS!""",7.2
Heretic, @FrawgfithAmblose  agreed also I make candles for hobby and even the freshest homemade candle doesn't smell as good as an actual pie cooking,7.2
Heretic, @bryansmith844 that’s just the design of the candle it’s supposed to look like pie filling stains,7.2
Heretic,"​@leifhesse he told them his wife was making a pie. When he goes to ""check"" on the pie, she noticed the burnt wick o. The candle and it says blueberry pie. He most likely blue out the candle before opening the door to make the scent of pie stronger",7.2
Heretic," @FrawgfithAmblose  its also possible that the black haired girl was already nervous and/or afraid, consciously or subconsciously, about being in a stranger’s home. Since she had not seen the wife yet, her mind probably went directly to the worst case scenario when she saw the candle.",7.2
Heretic,"​ @kyleh3227 He never said the pie was blueberry. Though, I wish he would have said it was blueberry",7.2
Heretic,Lol i was too stupid to understand her reaction til I read this.,7.2
Heretic,I don't think it's the pie scent I think it was the blood droplets on the label,7.2
Heretic,"So i’m kind of confused, his house is like a massive underground maze? That’s a shit ton of square feet bro must be rich",7.2
Heretic,"​ @boweryboy07 That's not critical thinking, that's a major deficit in context clues. How long have you even been alive?",7.2
Heretic," @bellissima78  When you can't support your argument, you resort to name-calling. That says a lot about you.",7.2
Heretic,​@leifhesse  yes they only went inthe house because he had a wife.  I believe he said she making a Blueberry pie. But when they saw the smell wasn't coming from the kitchen of pie. The smell was nothing but from a candle. Meaning he lied to lure them in his home. Where they already knew it wouldn't be safe if there is no women you might be in danger.  Now they know he a liar and they might be in danger,7.2
Heretic, @gibons9892 very good explanation I needed this I was so confused at first,7.2
Heretic," @kyleh3227  you almost nailed it there, although I do agree; the plot seems to be based on testing belief and knowing. yes, they smelled pie, they were told his wife was home... but was any of it true? absolutely not. the more chilling part, is he also says they can leave... belief or disbelief? I'm interested to find out",7.2
Heretic," @ryanhelms2769  to be fair, sometimes my Mom lights a candle and I come down thinking there's something in the oven. Don't underestimate the power of scented candles.",7.2
Heretic," @wykeyMo  Right!
The candle was lit in the beginning  - at 0:32, but after he left, it extinguished, probably decreasing the scent of pie and making them more certain that he lied...",7.2
Heretic," @LunarXZ_  ​ Exactly my thoughts!
Also, in a scene at 0:32, he purposefully puts the candle there right in front of their eyes, probably testing them...",7.2
Heretic," @foxx4847 He might have purposefully done that to test them, and/or to create bias in their choices...",7.2
Heretic,how are they fooled? those food scented candles dont actually smell like real food.,7.2
Heretic,"⁠ @leifhesse They say at the door they can’t come inside unless another woman is present. He says his wife has a pie in the oven. They discover the candle with pie scent. Hence, there is no pie nor wife who is baking.",7.2
Heretic,well im an idiot then. i thought there was blood splatter on the candle,7.2
Heretic,​@bryansmith844 thats what i noticed first that why i thought she was like were screwed. not because it was a scented candle 😂,7.2
Heretic, @gibons9892 it’s so dumb and unrealistic like who would actually notice that 💀,7.2
Heretic,​@leifhesse he used it to make the house smell like pie. When she saw it she realized it the smell wasn't a real pie so they played monopoly all night with milk and cookies and then the girls left and went to preach the lords name another day,7.2
Heretic,"​ @leifhesse jeez ppl have really gotten useless at understanding context, especially after the pandemic lock down. One would think that the extra movie/TV watching would actually help but..Idk what the reason is.. Is it too much small clips on tiktok etc? 
""Hmm, yes how do they understand there is no real blueberry pie just because they see a burning candle that smells like blueberries...?🤔",7.2
Heretic,"There is a pie. It’s just in the basement. An old lady eats it and dies. Another old lady appears through a trap door and makes it seem like she is resurrected.

Sorry to burst your bubble.

Hugh dies with a floor board with nails in it to his head.

One sister dies from stab wound from Hugh.

Two old ladies die in the basement.

Both doors lead to the same location.

Tons of anti Mormon tropes.

An old lady dies by eating a blueberry pie and another old lady replaces her.

Heretic,I didn't make that connection. Great point. I guess I need more coffee.,7.2
Heretic," @FrawgfithAmblose i would definitely think something is up and that he is lying about the pie in the oven before thinking that he’s just a pie fanatic. it’s also possible that there were other tells not shown in the trailer. lastly, it seems as if the girl in black was suspicious from the beginning and that was the conformation she needed.",7.2
Heretic,​ @FrawgfithAmblose Actually most women would be scared to discover the pie candle having been lit when there is supposed to be a wife baking a pie. Think about it. Why would you burn a pie scented candle when someone is baking a pie? That's ridiculous. You already have the scent in the air. Common sense would tell you that means he is lying which means they could be in danger. Their reaction was very realistic.,7.2
Heretic,"​ @ryanhelms2769 That's not true, there are tons of candles that smell just like desserts.",7.2
Heretic,​ @boweryboy07 But why would you bake a pie scented candle while someone is baking a pie? The smell of the pie will already be in the house.,7.2
Heretic,"​ @CMV314 It doesn't automatically mean he doesn't also have a pie cooking but why would you burn a pie scented candle while also baking a pie? Thats a waste of the candle since the smell of baking the pie will already be in the air. That's common sense and it's also common sense to assume someone you just met is lying to you when you encounter something that doesn't add up. You sound very trusting. If I met a stranger and encountered a scenario like that which wasn't adding up, I would get the hell out. Most people would.",7.2
Heretic,​ @wykeyMo He probably had one in the other room that is lit.,7.2
Heretic,​ @wykeyMo He probably has one in the other room. Or maybe he blow the candle out before he leaves the room.,7.2
Heretic,"​ @LunarXZ_ Yeah it will have a deeper meaning like you said. And no, high end candles smell just like the real thing. That's why I never burn candles that smell like food, it makes me so hungry!",7.2
Heretic,"​Like others have said, be probably does or says something that seems a bit odd, or else he's gone a really long time. OR most likely one of the girls checks the door, maybe to leave to get something she left in their car, then finds the door locked and they are like, ""Well that's weird"" and then they notice the candle.   It won't just be the candle, I bet.",7.2
Heretic,​There are tons of candles that smell like real pies. So much so that I hate them because they make me hungry.,7.2
Heretic,Why do trailers have to give everything away !  Would love for that to have been a surprise while watching the movie,7.2
Heretic," @Rojitos  it's not generational by any stretch of the imagination. it's more to do with how averages work and how low a bar ""average intelligence"" is considering half of everyone comes in under it.",7.2
Heretic, @gibons9892 thanks! I couldn’t understand why she got so nervous about the candle!,7.2
Heretic, @Youtubintheuser  I thought maybe his wife’s ashes are in the pie,7.2
Heretic, @leifhesse     This knowledge circles around the Canister Conundrum featured in several branches of narrative theory.   One can read more HERE,7.2
Heretic,Blueberry Pie scent made them assume he’s just another old bloke cooking for his wife and is mostly likely religious so he’s a good one. Until they saw the damn candle. Moral of the story - Don’t judge a person by their smell.,7.2
Heretic,"That was kind of dumb tho. Like it still could have been ""Real"" blueberry pie. That's being a bit paranoid actually. They could have made it be a little smarter than that.",7.2
Heretic,But what if he had a pie in the oven and a blueberry pie candle .. can't you have both .. are we not American?,7.2
Heretic,​ @leifhesse please don't get in to any vans coz some nice man offers you candy....,7.2
Heretic,"There's hairy pie, and he's definitely going to check on that.",7.2
Heretic,"I’m so dumb I didn’t even think that, I just thought oh the candle says blueberry pie and he’s making pie too.",7.2
Heretic, @scarlettkhan9667  that's what I also thought. Maybe the dude is obsessed with pie,7.2
Heretic, @leifhesse  It permits him to fake the smell of a pie in the oven. When there's no wife and no pie.,7.2
Heretic," @smylz4348 - Watch again, the candle WAS lit. I’ll bet he blows it out when he gets up to leave the room… hoping they are smart enough to start getting scared.",7.2
Heretic," @bagelbytes-d  - it’s not blood, its the berries in the art work of the label.",7.2
Heretic,"That candle just BETTA had really smelled the same. Cuz I aint never had no candle that convinced me of its ""scent"". Its usually like ""eh...close enough""",7.2
Heretic,Brining it back to the shining days with the maze diorama,7.2
Heretic,"The most they do is finance one or another film, because they are mostly a distributor; they do not participate in the artistic creation of any work.",7.2
Heretic,@JasonKing8113 so they can make a lot of money from low budget films. Great business model.,7.2
Heretic,That and unappealing naked people. And upside down camera angles. I should make a bingo card.,7.2
Heretic,"@Thatonehorrormoviefan  Heredity traumatised me, and I thought I was weird and then I found out there was a whole thread about it on Reddit.",7.2
Heretic,"​ @gonia24 It was quite a trip.😂 If you liked Hereditary, you might like Midsommar. If you haven't seen it already since it came out in 2019.",7.2
Heretic,"sometimes I forget how little the average person understands about these things. A24 has NOTHING to do with these films creatively, they just select and bankroll the projects that they think will make money",7.2
Heretic, @heyy-yaa  That is absolutely true. But it is also true that A24 has a certain style. They clearly chose to do so. I don't think it's fair to just reduce them to funding. Would many of these films get made otherwise? Likely. But some wouldn't and many would be different to due studio interference.,7.2
Heretic,"​ @ArchlordZer0  - Same here...dollhouses are excellent 'sidekicks' in horror movies.
Those shots of peeking through tiny windows, only to realize something's peering back...
At you. 😨",7.2
Heretic, @RTL2L  name a movie other than hereditary that does this. I'll wait,7.2
Heretic,God it is the one thing that made me instantly less intrigued. It’s never better for the inclusion of a stupid doll house.,7.2
Heretic," @Thatonehorrormoviefan  Oh no, is this by the same people who did Hereditary? In that case I won't bother with this. Damn, and I thought it looked somewhat good too.",7.2
Heretic,"@palkomedia they don't have creative control, but they have the ability to choose who they bring on. They go for a specific type of filmmaking. Slow burns, graphically horrific at times (if it's horror), artsy, quiet, great storytelling, ambiguous. So this comment is valid because A24 aren't making just anything and everything, they have a unique category of films that are similar to one another",7.2
Heretic, @MichaelDeHaven midsommar is slow burn on the human psyche. After getting through the movie you’re like “wow 🤔” and also “phew that was intense🙄 ”,7.2
Heretic, @gonia24 there’s a thread on reddit about everything. That’s the purpose of reddit,7.2
Heretic, @jonathanfaulkner878  Just don't make it a drinking game. It would be certain death.,7.2
Heretic,"Oh YEAH,that's right huh? They probably just have one guy working there that's really into like miniatures and doll houses and he's like ""okay so can we have a scene where the werewolf builds a doll house?"" and they're like ""No Bob we're not going to be able to squeeze a miniature into this movie, it's about werewolves in the Canadian arctic."" and Bob says ""This is a hostile work environment I quit.""",7.2
Heretic,Be Reconciled With Your Neighbor Before Approaching the Altar by Sensus Fidelium.,7.2
Heretic," @gonia24  traumatised you so much you can't even spell Hereditary properly, I see.",7.2
Heretic," @CommanderCodyChipless  Well, it outright stole the entire plot of Paranormal Activity 5, and then proceeded to make it so ridiculous that all horror went straight out the window, and all you could do was laugh. It's not even in the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category, it's just so bad that it's bad.",7.2
Heretic," @Wishbone1977  first of all paranormal activity's 5 plot isn't anywhere close to hereditary's plot. And if it was, it wasn't stolen because Ari Astor wrote the draft in 2013. Paranormal 5 came out in 2015. Virtually everything is different between the two films I don't even know how you can even say they are similar in plot. Ari Astor is by far one of the best horror film directors of modern times and most film critics agree. I seriously don't know how anyone can laugh at the tragic story of hereditary. That whole movie gave me chills. I sat in my car for like 30 minutes after watching that movie in theaters thinking to myself how f'd up it was. I was hooked in, and from there on its the only kind of horror I like. Midsommar, Rosemary's baby, The Blackcoat's Daughter, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Witch, The Lighthouse, Hereditary. And many more.",7.2
Heretic,"​ @heyy-yaa 
(Genuine question, I'm out of the loop & have no idea whwt A24 ia) What does that or any of this have to do with house models?",7.2
Heretic," @heyy-yaa  be that as it may, they crate. They have a certain aesthetic when it comes to what is or isn't an A24 movie. I'll fully admit I know zilch about how the sausage gets made but I do know that I generally like A24 horror movies. Doesn't matter if A24 is just the fucking caterer",7.2
Heretic,"My friend works for them, and that's not true. A production company can be arranged in advance,  films aren't always made without distributors. In fact, they're made WITH a company quite often.",7.2
Heretic," @FrithonaHrududu02127  nothing you said here was remotely meaningful or informative in any way, but thanks.",7.2
Heretic,"So did Bob really quit or it was just a threat? I feel I can empathize with Bob, he is an artist and they dont understand that. He has a beautiful vision and they want to ruin it by just accepting any disgusting trash. I don't know how he continues to survive whilst surrounded by the peasants.",7.2
Heretic," @FR0_MAGNUM  this is a really pointless thing to say. If A24 just simply bankrolled any project their name wouldn't be as well known as it is. They specifically bankroll projects that fit their style. They control the indie horror market, make incredible dramas and slow burn indie darlings. They're curators and they have excellent taste.",7.2
Heretic," @rainierr9356  for me, it's the fact that no other horror movie went that far in showing the utter horror of the car accident. The way you sit with the son in the car after the coughing stops and you can see the realization of what he's done appear on his face. I haven't felt such a feeling ever again from a movie. It felt like i was the one who caused the accident and the guilt and horror physically affected me. Not to mention the screams in the morning when the mother finds the body. Adding again to the horror, trauma and guilt.

At the end it goes off the rails when the mother is flying around the room, but it's so intense and just fucked up that the possessed mother is attacking her son and the creepy naked people in the hallway just serves to completely unsettle you that you can look past the weird supernatural stuff. Even without Paimon, if the movie had just been an emotionally distraught mother snaps and kills her family, it would have still been the best horror movie of the year.",7.2
Heretic,​ @CommanderCodyChipless the only thing I didn't like about hereditary was the end with the treehouse. With the visuals and stuff you could tell how low budget it was. But since I could grasp the concept of what they were portraying I thoroughly enjoyed it. Midsommars visuals were amazing! And it's storyline was pretty epic and unique. I agree with everything you said about ari astor,7.2
Heretic," @rndm589  I mean I can respect that. The only thing I'd say in refute of that opinion is I thought the ending was perfect. The low effort of Paimon's Church (the tree house) just breeds realism to the fact that if a satanic cult (and Christian mythology) existed, the Church would look just like that. Not like irl satanic churches where it's all stylish and has the aesthetic of a metal band's album cover. Instead, Paimon's Church is just the treehouse, the dead bodies, a statue with Charlie's head, the bird in the cage and a picture of the Queen of Paimon. I will say it's hard to deny that the practical effect dead body of the grandma looked a little off (her arm was round-looking around the elbow). Just should have done cgi for that part considering it was in a bright room and not in the dark.",7.2
Heretic,"​ @thelessimportantajmichel287 dude, this. It's usually the ""White Rabbit"" by Jefferson Airplane that they throw in a horror movie trailer chopped and screwed.",7.2
Heretic,"Can we find something else to make a movie about? The elaborate maze, ridicules faith-based young women. Women are in danger as well. You don't need to wonder why Americans are viewed as aggressive. You make entertainment about suffering.",7.2
Heretic,@CommanderCodyChipless  considering he offered his opinion clearly and concisely my guess is he is doing fine.,7.2
Heretic," @rebel107  well you didn't consider enough. You should have considered the context of his comment, not just the fact he commented. I personally think he isn't doing fine. Something off with him forsure",7.2
Heretic,"Alot of a24 stuff is just distributed by them, they def make alot of their own movies like a studio but they are mainly a distributor for indie films",7.2
Heretic,"​ @mattlow8074  Marketing melts people's brains. People think A24 is writing, directing...everything. They love the brand A24 so much despite not actually knowing what it is lol",7.2
Heretic,Yeahh Hereditary was probably one of the best modern day horror films I’ve ever seen,7.2
Heretic,"But God has helped me to this very day; so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen— that the Messiah would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would bring the message of light to his own people and to the Gentiles. 

Acts 26:22-23",7.2
Heretic, @konrad1916 would you like to come to my house to teach me the gospel? It’s a nice house a lot like the one in the trailer,7.2
Heretic, @julianwilliams9088 I’d be open to! No weapon formed against me shall prosper. Plus I’m armed… with my Bible 👍👍,7.2
Heretic,"Still gave too much away. We know basically the whole plot, all that's left is, do they make it out or not",7.2
Heretic," @konrad1916  
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.   Matthew 5:16",7.2
Heretic,It's a terrible trailer. The only things it doesn't reveal are Hugh Grant's motives and the conclusion.,7.2
Heretic,"The build and realization is what drives terror into people especially in real life, it’s awesome to see them utilize that in cinema",7.2
Heretic,yup keep it simple and introduce the concept not the plot.,7.2
Heretic,"Personally I thought ""We have no idea what this movie is about, not a good trailer to get people hooked.""",7.2
Heretic," @SLOTHSRIDEUNICORNS  lol lovingly, you don’t have it in you to harm me. And this isn’t an insult",7.2
Heretic," @nickbaby29 either he was a believer and the wife and/or kid died tragically, wife was a believer and still died, both were believers and wife still died. I’ll wait until it’s streaming for free.",7.2
Heretic,"EXACTLY this. Regardless of the quality of films and trailers now a days. The online world has made all the big studios motivated to give their audience fast and instant gratification. By spoil the whole f*cking movie en best parts. And it sucks! So this, makes me happy and gives me hope.

Btw: free advice. To solve this problem most of the times. Watch a trailer exactly to the point where you are intrigued, stop the trailer and just watch the movie when you can.",7.2
Heretic," @nnslg  There is still so much left to find out. What was the thing behind her? What are his motives? what is behind each door? what is the ""miracle""? I think they showed just enough.",7.2
Heretic," @TylerDurden-cu6iz  okay, what are his motives for keeping them captive? What is the “miracle” he tells them they are going to witness? What is behind each door? Are there supernatural elements? Since you know the plot you should be able to answer these questions no problem.",7.2
Heretic,⁠ @konrad1916 OK. Maybe god should help you to find better zombie movies 🤷🏽‍♂️,7.2
Heretic, @chrisbaker7583  bro thinks I'm gonna write him an essay because he couldn't understand what was going on 🤣,7.2
Heretic," @TylerDurden-cu6iz  not at all, I’m just making a point. You don’t know the answers to any of those questions, because none of that information was revealed in the trailer…bro",7.2
Heretic,@chrisbaker7583  I heard there's a new transformers movie coming out that you might be able to follow that'd be better suited for you little buddy,7.2
Heretic, @TylerDurden-cu6iz  you’re the one who can’t comprehend the point im making.,7.2
Heretic," @TylerDurden-cu6iz  we know the *premise* after the trailer. I have no idea why Grant’s character is holding them, what’s in the basement or what our two protagonists’ character arcs are going to be. Plenty of questions to explore",7.2
Heretic,until we actually watch the movie and realize that's what it's gonna be all the way through,7.2
Heretic,"Scott Beck is a joke! Anyone who challenges other beliefs yet hides their own stance of beliefs, life, and morals is not to be taken serious or any or their work. They are more closely related to trolls.",7.2

Heretic," @nickbaby29 Hugh dies by a floorboard to the head with nails in it and one of the sister missionaries does too. 

False representations of LDS theology are discussed throughout.

The surviving sister missionary escapes and the movie tries to make you question if God exist or if He doesn’t.",7.2
Heretic,actually it should have ended when she spots the label on the candle,7.2
Heretic,​ @konrad1916  go listen to Profanatica and Nunslaughter and take your religious vomit elsewhere,7.2
Heretic,Now imagine if they’d set a film as such but with Pee Wee Herman !,7.2
Heretic, @nnslg  that's why i stopped watching the whole trailer and skip thru it for maybe 10 secs of lol,7.2
Heretic, @nickbaby29   that's why i stopped watching the whole trailer and skip thru it for maybe 10 secs of lol,7.2
Heretic,putting runners in the maze was such a good call tbh,7.2
Heretic,Maze Runner done right. Still disappointed those movies wasted such a committed performance from Dylan O'Brien. They could've been so much better.,7.2
Heretic, @ComedyBros5 when I saw the first one I thought it was gonna be an amazing series of movies but I was only disappointed afterwards,7.2
Heretic, @ComedyBros5 you’re acting like the books were some kind of high art to begin with,7.2
Heretic," @fabiandelatorre437  Yep, same here. That first one is such a blast to watch. The second one is okay but a mess. The 3rd one is almost unwatchable.",7.2
Heretic," @YodaOnABender  No I'm not. They're good books that warranted good movies, not the trash we got.",7.2
Heretic, @ComedyBros5  movies were better tbh. At least you could actually  coherently follow the plot of the movies,7.2
Heretic,Nah maze runner is sci fi. This is giving Saw vibes.,7.2
Heretic,"It reminds me a little bit of the Matrix, i.e., blue pill vs. red pill.",7.2
Heretic,"The reboot will still acknowledge O'Brian's movies. It's basically extension of the universe. 
My guess is we will see the other experiment. Where all girls + one boy are put in the maze.

But I do wonder how they gonna keep it interesting. Bcs we all know the Maze was an experiment.",7.2
Heretic,I don't think Hugh Grant was available when the Maze Runner series was filmed...,7.2
Heretic,Just saw the movie last night and sorry to disappoint you but there’s no Maze in the film.,7.2
Heretic,@taylorbrown8329  yep I saw it and there really was a distinct absence of mazes and running,7.2
Heretic,That... sounds fucking amazing! Love this! This definitely needs more likes!,7.2
Heretic,"nah man, only a crazy person will trap someone just cause they have beliefs...",7.2
Heretic, @asmrtina6966  It's almost like this is an outlandish horror movie or something. Lol,7.2
Heretic, @legofan370  yeah its almost like this is weird and has always been weird,7.2
Heretic,"Woof, that sounds pretty saw. Unless the end is God going all Lost  Ark on his ass.",7.2
Heretic,"@isobel64  The allegory for religious belief is front and centre but I actually meant that he is going to literally mislead them, repeatedly, in the movie.",7.2
Heretic, @asmrtina6966  thousands of years of human history would like to disagree,7.2
Heretic, @asmrtina6966  You know religious freedom is a relatively young concept right? Roughly a couple hundred years old or so. Before that we were killing each other everywhere because of beliefs.,7.2
Heretic,"I that the way he said ""does my wife count?"" would have fooled me also 🤣",7.2
Heretic,"Is A24 becoming the studio that just makes cringe/trash woke allegory horror, now? What is this $hit?",7.2
Heretic,"I'd just assume the guy really likes Blueberry Pie. We're conditioned to assume the norm, not the exception.",7.2
Heretic,​ @Largentina. Is it sane to trap someone because of their beliefs?,7.2
Heretic,I don’t get the comment about the pie candle…explain what I’m missing,7.2
Heretic,I think his first test was telling them his wife was inside and asking if that counted. They believed him without asking for proof.,7.2
Heretic," @asmrtina6966 you nailed it, it’s another propaganda movie to turn people away from faith",7.2
Heretic," @isobel64  , oh but they do. No difference there, but for the ability to adjust to human race moral development where mainstream Christianity does have somewhat better progress than other Abrahamic religions. It still lags behind simple secular humanism though.",7.2
Heretic,"Why do I have a feeling the girl who chooses the ""BELIEF"" door will get killed right away?",7.2
Heretic,"What a nice guy, kinda like jigsaw but for people who haven't done anything wrong",7.2
Heretic,"I feel like this movie will be very philosophical especially to those who are very deep in faith.

The term Heretic refers to someone who actively practices different forms of Heresy which leads into the definition of Heresy which is beliefs that differ from Orthodox religions. 

So. What's the opposite of a person of faith? An atheist. 

The dude isn't a Satanist. He's more than likely a psycho that believes fact over faith. And he's studying whether or not faith can truly save someone when their life depends on it. 

This miracle he speaks of. May either be an act of God or it may be an act of human will.",7.2
Heretic," @Chunter060 😂😅😂😅😂😅, I really wish you all could see how others react to yours, and others, viewpoints such as the one you made in this thread!!",7.2
Heretic, @Chunter060  wacko's like you do more to turn people away from faith than this movie ever could lol.,7.2
Heretic,RIGHT ON POINT!!! such an amazing allusion religion how people tend to blindly follow that's why it's so important to KNOW your faith,7.2
Heretic, @Chunter060 because faith can’t be propaganda and children and young adults aren’t thrown into religion by force from their parents,7.2
Heretic,"Way to much thought into ""Time to get rid of those annoying Mormons twisting my faith.""",7.2
Heretic,"Good idea. This would also work if you substitute religious belief for belief in the government, politcial science, official party lines, and ""the man on the news""",7.2
Heretic, @ladydiaspora807 but isn’t that the moral to every horror movie 😂,7.2
Heretic," @jennyterrell6354  Sorry I can’t respond to this sort of sentence structure, as much as I did try to make sense of it",7.2
Heretic," @Yeahhgary  Faith is not propaganda, religions can often be however. The person who may ridicule faith usually has faith himself in tried and trusted friends. The scientist has faith in the principles of his branch of science. He bases new experiments on past discoveries and looks for new discoveries on the basis of those things already established as true. Likewise, the farmer prepares his soil and sows the seed, expecting, as in previous years, that the seed will sprout and that the plants will grow as they receive the needed moisture and sunshine. Therefore faith in the stability of the natural laws governing the universe actually constitutes a foundation for man’s plans and activities.",7.2
Heretic,In the mean time he terrorises them and keeps the prisoner so he can prove his own theory. Do you want to do that to all religious people ?,7.2
Heretic, @NicholasWood-y4k  Well we still are now its just nationalism that the new religion.,7.2
Heretic," @Mulberry2000  We are living in one of the most peaceful times in human history. I get that there are wars going on and geopolitics at play, but overall most of the world is at peace.",7.2
Heretic," @Mulberry2000  This is exactly right, and it appears to be the subliminal messaging judging from the trailer.",7.2
Heretic,​ @HonkHonkler  what is woke? It is being applied to damn near everything I dont even know what people mean anymore.,7.2
Heretic, @NicholasWood-y4k  yeah the past was crazy and grotesque and thats why most ppl have stopped it now. and now we all find it weird but apparently not weird enough to make movies about it.,7.2
Heretic," @Yeahhgary  this is ALSO a very digestible movie plot, its a repeat of the same story of serial killers full of themselves, it boring af and at the end of the movie will have zero impact and be easily forgettable. this is just SAW-lite with hugh grant ffs.",7.2
Heretic," @NicholasWood-y4k  You are living in a bunker my friend, just out of curiosity what data are you using as a variable to draw that conclusion?",7.2
Heretic," @Chunter060  Man history is riddled with examples. Genghis Khan. Alexander the Great. The persian empire. Nordic vikings. The Aztecs. The british, spain, and roman colonial empires. Manifest Destiny and the westward expansion of America. Both world wars. The various skirmishes and wars between protestants and Catholics that plagued middle ages Europe. The crusades. I could go on. Just open a history book.",7.2
Heretic," @NicholasWood-y4k  That was not my question, I asked what variable are you using to test the world being at peace against? These are examples of world powers and wars throughout history, are those your variables? Explanation please",7.2
Heretic," @Chunter060  its not a science question bud. We arent using the scientific method. We are talking about modern geopolitics and war comparatively to historical accounts of war. If you think the russo ukrainian war, or what is happening in palestine at this time today are remotely comparable to historical wars you know nothing. The scale of modern war has collapsed, mostly due to this on off cold war the major powers today are in constantly. Stop trying to sound smart. Its not a good look for ya.",7.2
Heretic,I think you really get this movie’s topic and movie’s name is heretic it makes sense,7.2
Heretic, @asmrtina6966  damn bud offended by a horror movie must suck to be you,7.2
Heretic," @ANGELMAN.  not really a horror movie, more thriller/gore cause this shit is happening anyway in rl... horror is cooler with supernatural elements in it and far more interesting, gives you existential crisis if its good enough. shit you cant explain. another guy getting his rocks off to torture isnt new or interesting, just another pos ....",7.2
Heretic,Will it be a crime in a coming theocracy?  Curious !,7.2
Heretic,It seems like a very healthy way to discuss god and faith 😂,7.2
Heretic,Yeah - I hate ones that give away key plot points,7.2
Heretic,Well considering its A24 I doubt you will ever see a trailer like you hinted to on here.,7.2
Heretic, @TheRealWattLife  they showed them having to choose a door to go through and that's it. Do you already know everything that happens from that point on? No.,7.2
Heretic,"​ @TheRealWattLife lol, they ""literally"" didn't show the entire movie. 😂 This was a preview, literally.",7.2
Heretic,"sameee, I tried to avoid/ stop watching trailers for that reason",7.2
Heretic,Too bad there’s ones like Longlegs that advertise it as the “scariest of the decade” and it’s mostly just quiet shots of a girl in rooms looking scared Nic Cage being creepy for 8 minutes of it and about 10 minutes of weird satan imagery that’s it it’s not fuckin scary.,7.2
Heretic," @charlestonw801st  I just read that review, it sounds like such a letdown..",7.2
Heretic," @6daysago167  ah man just wait for streaming I’ve never seen a horror movie so overly hyped and a theater just get up and leave so quickly afterwards all I was hearing was “that fuckin sucked” and “wish we could’ve seen Maxxxine instead”. Thats how I felt as well there’s nothing unique there’s nothing new about it unless non verbal autism counts, oh yeah also biggest thing Cage is only in it for maybe 8 minutes total too.",7.2
Heretic,"Still too much. We found out Hugh is a bad guy, there's no wife, the girls get kidnapped and are used as some sort of experiment. The old school trailers would've just shown Hugh answering the door and that's it. The voice-over would've done all the work.",7.2
Heretic, @Cyba_IT  what kind of preview would just show someone answering a door?? Seriously? We wouldn’t understand any of the plot from that sort of preview..,7.2
Heretic," @6daysago167  Why would you want to understand the plot from the preview? All you need to know is who is in it and whether it's a comedy, action, romance, drama or whatever. Too many trailers give the plot away completely",7.2
Heretic," @Cyba_IT  I never said that I wanted to understand the “plot from the preview”
In fact, I said that I was grateful not to understand it.",7.2
Heretic, @Cyba_IT  did you graduate elementary school? Can you comprehend anything that I’ve said??,7.2
Heretic, @Cyba_IT  I don’t want much of anything from the preview other than the gist… that’s all.,7.2
Heretic,"Glad I'm not the only one to notice that crap. I'm always like, well I've seen enough! It's so stupid. My mom showed me this movie from her day called the Bad Seed (1956). I liked it and went to read about it. People actually did a good job keeping the ending secret, as they were asked too. No commercials spoiling shit. But now, people will ruin films on purpose, for fun! People suck, but yeah, I'm not interested when they show the poignant and critical parts of a film. It's infuriating, the stupidity. I just go, well I'll wait for it to stream!",7.2
Heretic,How we know he’s the bad guy? They love to do twist in these movies. I think the trailer did a good job.,7.2
Heretic,only a matter of time when they show too much. tbh,7.2
Heretic,I mean they kinda reveal a bit too much at the end but it’s still intriguing,7.2
Heretic,Right bro this felt like a tbt I’m from the 90s,7.2
Heretic,those previews that make you want to see the move are often just called trailers XPPP,7.2
Heretic,"⁠​⁠ @Cyba_IT  Facts man. Until you said that about them giving away the wife thing, etc., i'm realizing these are all things I would rather have found out in the movie. And I know exactly what you mean about the trailers back then. They never showed much at all but somehow always got the job done.",7.2
Heretic,What do you mean they basically showed the movie in this lol,7.2
Heretic,​@TheRealWattLife I watched this movie and there is NO WAY you can fathom what happens in the movie from this trailer. It was a phenomenal movie,7.2
Heretic,Omg same!!!! I hate the ones that show the whole damn movie I stop them in the middle so annoying,7.2
Heretic," @Cyba_IT how are you supposed to understand that it’s a horror movie if you aren’t shown that grant’s character doesn’t have a wife at home or a pie in the oven? either it tells you, it doesn’t tell you but in a voiceover says it’s a horror movie (at which point you should be able to understand he said both those things to make them comfortable enough to enter and that they’re not actually true anyway), or it doesn’t tell you any of that and you have no sense from the trailer what the actual tone or genre of the movie is. how is showing the villain of the movie a spoiler if it’s probably revealed in the first 10 minutes and entire rest of the movie hinges on it? i would understand if you didn’t want it to reveal anything about how he seems to want to put them through some sort of test, but it seems silly to want the trailer to end with the two girls knocking at the door but also somehow indicate it’s a horror without revealing that grant is the bad guy? how would you even do that without putting two and two together anyway?",7.2
Heretic,I’m not a huge horror fan but this set-up with Hugh Grant looks really good😋,7.2
Heretic,"gotta thank you for saying the song’s name, comments like these save my life",7.2
Heretic," @urealmax1077  BTW, if it's of interest, that song is supposed to have inspired (or been pilfered for) Radiohead's Creep.  I love both bands and both songs, so I have no strong opinion on that, but it might be a song that you like as it has a similar chord structure and tempo.",7.2
Heretic, @KekeElBecko   have you saw the movie yet? Your comment actually has some connection to the movie…(I just saw a preview on halloween😊),7.2
Heretic,"if you like HG in horror roles, check out the trippy Lair of the White Worm",7.2
Heretic,I loved the song as a kid.what memories of better times in life.The simple life❤❤😊,7.2
Heretic, @KekeElBecko you should definitely see the movie and come back to this comment lol,7.2

Heretic,​ @nevetsny1  now THAT iz a lye 🤣 jus say U havnt tasted enuff pie 😭💀,7.2
Heretic,Offering pie when you know darn well you have none should be illegal!,7.2

It's just a coincidence that I also drive a vintage Chevy Impala & hunt demons with my brother.",7.2

Heretic,Thanks for the review without giving away any spoilers. Someone else said it's definitely a 2 times must watch movie. Can't wait to check it out,7.2
Heretic,Hi - my son is 11 and he wants to watch it. Would this movie be ok for him to watch?,7.2
Heretic," @jasonlee6180 hi, there are some bl”d scenes but the movie is great, pure suspense, no screamers and a really good idea. I think it’ll be ok for him!",7.2
Heretic,"Huh???  The minute Grant goes into this rant, I hear groans and the movie loses the audience.",7.2
Heretic,people act like everything they touch turns to gold. yet lots of shit comes out of the studio. all they do is produce stuff... they have no relation to the creative process other than that. I have been disappointed plenty by A24. Anyone who praises them like this is an edgelord who fancies themselves a movie critic,7.2
Heretic,"Such a great film concept! Just like the thought process of an Auschwitz guard in 1943: ""What happens to an adherent's religious beliefs when he or she is tortured? Let's find out.""",7.2
Heretic," @dizzlegrizzle1919 The salt 😂 I appreciate them like I appreciate Blumhouse, whether or not all their films are my thing they have helped facilitate a lot of stuff I’ve really really enjoyed",7.2
Heretic,"I haven’t watched every movie A24 has made over the past 10 years so I can’t speak to all of them, but I have loved all of the ones I saw and some of them are among the best movies made this century. A24 is absolutely rampaging",7.2
Heretic,"Growing up with Hugh Grant as a giant in a genre I wasn’t interested in, it’s great to see him finally coming over to my (our?) camp!",7.2
Heretic, @dizzlegrizzle1919 I agree these guys are the Marvel of horror. Maybe good at one point and occasionally once in a while they’ll give you something competent but 95% of the time it’s just shit that an amateur film student could’ve made 😂,7.2
Heretic, @dizzlegrizzle1919  99%+ of the audience have no idea how films are made. They see the A24 logo and think 'oh OK I guess A24 is like a dude who made the film',7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant Stole this !! But then again I was raised in that CULT paid my LD$ Dues and Ran!! LOVED IT !!!,7.2
Heretic,"What they experienced in the labyrinth was the Organic Light (in Greece, not in the film) or the naked body of the wisdom Goddess Sophia. In the case of the Eleusinian mysteries, She is represented by Demeter, ironically it is the ergot on the wheat that infused the Kykeon.",7.2
Heretic,"That would be so dope if true, specially that you figured it out",7.2
Heretic,Side note I hope you work for the cia or some shit cause true or not that was incredible,7.2
Heretic,"I can't read in case it's a spoiler but all I picked up on was the camera at the end pulls out to reveal a modal. I think Hugh Grant is ""God"" or the ""creator"" and he is testing them. Like Adam and Eve. Or maybe he is the devil. Will be subtle though. I think a metaphorical movie. Looks good.",7.2
Heretic,"Very detailed and thought out premise or summarization of the movie based on the trailer alone. I am hoping you were not one of the lucky few who were able to watch the movie at the toronto film festival. 

And if your deduction is indeed just that and turns out to be incorrect... A24 should hire you to write that movie!!  Heck I'd watch it 10 times just because it was THAT GOOD! 

Heck write a short story/novel about it!!! And become the new Stephen King.",7.2
Heretic,"Just wait for the movie out, and chill the F out, instead of trying to guess..",7.2
Heretic,Who cares what you found out or how many times you watched anything not trying to be mean but its kinda ignorant no-one wants to hear your guess that is interested or hasn't seen the movie,7.2
Heretic, @teamjesus2322  You sound like a real Christian. I bet he loves you very much.,7.2
Heretic,"I love this idea! And I really hope it turns out to be something like this, if not of a similar nature! I'm excited to see this movie, but the idea that this might be another spiritual horror film that puts LDS Saints or God in a bad light makes me hesitant to go see it",7.2
Heretic,"@mikeymumbelz9063
Oh interesting.
Question though:
What do you think could explain the last scene in this trailer?
Did Hugh shrink that girl?
Or did he construct a huge table and made a giant notebook?

P.S.
There is another trailer that is out.
I hope you could check it out and give some of your thoughts on that one (which shows the Dante Diagram)",7.2
Heretic,a lot of the nightmare is in the lack of consent,7.2

Heretic, @Saturnia2014  Was just going to comment that. Hugh the cannibal killer.,7.2
Heretic, @diceman199  As a German I respectfully disagree. You are pretty good though. :D,7.2
Heretic,"He's not a Brit, he's English and yes princess, there is a difference...tell us all you're from the states without actually telling us... information is free, knowledge is as well... wisdom is knowing the difference... stay in school",7.2
Heretic," @datgrrl_official  Yes, but the English are British because they live in the British Isles, also known as Britannia. Isn't it true that the English are British? Maybe they moved to Easter Island?",7.2
Heretic,"Now now, the jury is in yet. He may not be a killer at all, just a big practical joker!",7.2
Heretic,Because he’s so friendly and warming that you look at him and are like “something’s off.”,7.2
Heretic,now that he is old it's more suitable ! it just works,7.2
Heretic,"He got the gentlemanly charm and at the same time, vague/mysterious aura if he plays it well. That's his natural skill as an actor (as far as I've watched his roles).",7.2
Heretic,Implied!  He might not have killed anyone.  YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!!!  NO MAN IS AN ISLAND!!,7.2
Heretic, @datgrrl_official  who are you replying too? If it was me calling him a brit....well I call myself a brit as well and I was born in england,7.2
Heretic,⁠​⁠ @datgrrl_official  Why don’t you learn how to use punctuation correctly? Stay in school; stop ellipsis abuse.,7.2
Heretic,"Funny, ive just beennwsiting for him to try it without leaning on Camp.  Tim Curry scares the snot out of you when he suddedly drops the camp routine, this looks like a similar tactic.",7.2
Heretic," @Nexils  oh and in the Undoing😱 omg, he was actually scary in that show",7.2
Heretic,I'm not sure Hugh is a psycho killer in this movie. More....a facilitator for the real monster.,7.2
Heretic,Does he?! I was basically lolling the entire trailer thanx to Hugh! 😅,7.2
Heretic,​ @AkiTerry  lots of people like you with not much between the ears,7.2
Heretic,"​ @Saturnia2014  I remember him more as a terrifying tribesman but now that I recall, he was scary as a corporate villain.",7.2
Heretic,Whoa whoa whoa. Who said he was a killer. We just jumped right to conclusions didn’t we. 😜,7.2
Heretic," @tealsquare  All good, you don't have to insult me to defend ""Clout Atlas"" 😂
I would understand & deserve an insult if I said ""nobody watched the godfather"", but you really started to get personal because of ""Clout Atlas"" 😄 hehehe",7.2
Heretic, @AkiTerry   nah...I don't care what movie you go after. No need to ridicule people for the things they care about.,7.2
Heretic," @datgrrl_official   LOL  If the English are not British, I guess the American Colonists had it wrong with ""The British are coming!'  If, according to you, the English are not British, then neither are the Welsh or Scottish.  So, who, then, are the British?????  All English are British, but not all British are English.",7.2
Heretic,"Well, we don't really know what he is, just based on this trailer",7.2
Heretic,That's because he is a classically trained actor who has never stooped so low.,7.2
Heretic, @diceman199  you sent all the real bad guys to Oz :),7.2
Heretic," @datgrrl_official  English are British. For someone giving quotes about wisdom, you seem rather bereft of it.",7.2
Heretic,Agreed. I thought the same about ethan hawke after that telephone movie,7.2
Heretic, @datgrrl_official .  He’s English.  He’s a Brit.  So am I.    Try less.,7.2
Heretic," @XMaster340  Just wanna say, that lil back and forth was both dark, and hilarious. HAHA! Also, Peter Cushing = Grand Moff Tarkin. Soooo, yeah.We're talking 'fiction'....right? HA!",7.2
Heretic,Calling it now. Hugh is the good guy in the story.,7.2
Heretic,Never underestimate the power of an actor that has done a shitload of Rom-Coms.,7.2
Heretic," @rumblefish9  Yes ,funny how i saw this on an ad after watching that.Kept me guessing almost until the end.",7.2
Heretic,"Me too.  I don't do scary movies,  but he looks really great in this trailer. 😮",7.2
Heretic," @MexicoCityLAMB  SAME I wanted to believ he was innocent so bad, the ending shocked me!",7.2
Heretic,apparently he almost didn't outlive his romcom years. Hugh was notoriously difficult to work with and studios stopped calling him for a while. He must have chilled out these past few years.,7.2
Heretic,Makes you wonder what happened to all the women his characters have married in those romcoms.,7.2
Heretic," @modernorpheus You think they’re in pieces buried in his backyard, don’t you.",7.2
Heretic,He was always a really good actor. Maurice (1987) was the movie that made me realize that. People need to watch the movie Maurice. His character in the book version is terrible but Hugh managed to find the humanity and vulnerability in him.,7.2
Heretic," @ziggypop8106  don't get me wrong, I love a good hugh film. This one's going to be great, by the looks of it.",7.2
Heretic,He was in a series called A Very English Scandal as Jeremy Thorpe. I thought he was good in it,7.2
Heretic," @DiBBs277 I hope he was tolerant for this movie, how do these actors who have reputations of being hard to work with like Hugh Grant, Edward Norton, Jared Leto or Wesley Snipes but still get work is weird.",7.2
Heretic," @ytuser_3122 he’s not hard to work with. There are headlines and there is context. Not enough people read past headlines or watch the actual clips. People joke about Hugh being terrible, but he’s a friend to all of them. He’s your curmudgeonly friend.",7.2
Heretic," @ytuser_3122  perhaps these stories are just rumors spread by rivals, which is why people who have actually worked with them keep asking to work with them again?",7.2
Heretic,@ytuser_3122  How do ordinary people in every day life who are hard to work with still get jobs? 😆,7.2
Heretic,My favorite Hugh Grant role is as the claymation pirate captain in Aardman’s Pirates Band of Misfits. 🤣 🏴‍☠️ 🍖 ⚔️,7.2
Heretic,NOTHING ABOUT THE MOVIE ONLY AN ACTOR. I Don't WANT TO See IT TILL I KNOW WHAT ITS ABOUT,7.2
Heretic,I feel like he is having so much fun with these kinds of roles he's been doing recently! Good for him!,7.2
Heretic,"Yeah, it suits him because he actually is a villain in real life. Ask Rebecca Ferguson.",7.2
Heretic,That was back in the 90s. He hasn't really been doing many romcoms over the last 20 years.,7.2
Heretic,BRILLIANTLY DONE ! But then again I was raised LD$ at ground 0 - I get it,7.2
Heretic," @JamieBentall  I had to say all these  ummmm...pauses out loud, tnx for the lol",7.2
Heretic,"THIS is how trailers should be done, and not a montage of the whole movie. I'm now interested to see it.",7.2
Heretic,"I just got back from seeing this film and all I can say is I am literally blown away. The acting (especially HUGH GRANT AND SOPHIE THATCHER!!!), the writing and everything about this film was so methodical and deep that it constantly hits you with plot twist after plot twister. To call this a horror movie is an understatement. This whole film is ART.",7.2
Heretic,"HG's character answers the door, holding a watering can on a rainy day. He says his wife is "" home."" He lights the blueberry pie candle right in front of them. If this character wanted to do something discreetly, it seems like he would. It's like he's testing how far he can go on the strength of the ladies' subconscious acceptance of what he says versus what their environment demonstrates. 
I'm looking forward to seeing this!",7.2
Heretic,High Grant is so perfect at acting in a way that’s disarming and then switching on a dime while still being charming… incredible!,7.2
Heretic,That classic Hugh Grant downward smile works so well for this horror character! LOVE IT!,7.2
Heretic,"1:52 i absolutely love how he says this to them, an obvious reference to angels. it’s such a simple yet effective line.",7.2
Heretic,"Love the awkward face he pulls when he says “it may even make you want to die”
Classic Grant.",7.2
Heretic,"Hugh Grant: ""do not be afraid.""

Everyone: ""already shat my pants.""",7.2
Heretic,If this trailer ended at 01:04 it would be an incredible teaser,7.2
Heretic,"Glad to see Hollywood finally starting to get it right with the trailers; showing just enough, and not tryna cramp the entire movie into a 3-minute montage with overused sound effects. The trailer for ""Longlegs"" blew my mind, too... Absolutely love to see it. Bravo, A24!!!",7.2
Heretic,"The movie is called Heretic and ties into the history of the word as it has been associated with the history of the Christian religion as the word is based on the Ancient Greek word: Haeretikos, which means, ""I choose"".

Brilliant title and movie theming.",7.2
Heretic,"Life is crazy, I'm 32 and seeing Hugh Grant older is making me realize how fast it all goes...",7.2
Heretic,Just come out of seeing this in the cinema and.....wow that shot of the watering can at 0:18 makes a LOT more sense now 😐,7.2
Heretic,"Ever since Hugh Grant’s amazing performance in the Gentlemen, he has been taking his career in a very different direction and I love it!",7.2
Heretic,"Here in Indonesia where it's a very religious country, I'm sure movies like this will be underrated & slept by people. Few people will probably ever watch such daring & risky film, let alone to deeply understand the messages of the film. I truly admire the filmmaker for being courageous enough to make a bold, non cookie-cutter movie like this! Finally, a high-quality movie that can be discussed deeply & makes people think.",7.2
Heretic,"I didn't think much of this film when I walked in. But right from the start, the movie sucks you in, thought-provoking themes concerning religion. I won't spoil it for the rest who haven't seen it. Fantastic acting from Hugh Grant and the 2 female leads. One of the best movies I've seen this year.",7.2
Heretic,"The way he just puts the candle out there,in front of those girls is just genius. They have no idea what's about to hit them.",7.2
Heretic,You interested in Longlegs too?  Those trailers scared the shit out of me and I still only know as much as the synopsis.,7.2
Heretic," @Diddyparty-m9g  One of Longlegs 30 second teasers sincerely scared me enough to check under my bed, no lie.  When I go into the theater I’ll have a blanket and a flashlight P",7.2
Heretic, @KainErrow  I've seen the trailer. It looks scarier than this. I might give it a watch as well.,7.2
Heretic,Hugh dies. One sister lives. Tons of anti Mormon tropes throughout the movie.,7.2
Heretic, @Cherry-ou6qk   yip! If they had an Oscar category for best trailer this would be going home with a statue for sure🙌🏻,7.2
Heretic,How are you going to leave out Chloe East’s acting ? She was phenomenal,7.2
Heretic,Are there any screamers in the film? Does it get really gory? I want to see it in the cinema but I hate screamers.,7.2
Heretic,"You're not wrong, but I don't think watering indoor plants when it's raining is a red flag?  :P  

I'm not hating, though, you make good points about the other stuff.",7.2
Heretic,"@lolomcspanky  I agree. I can't firmly decide if it was significant or not. But, it stood out to me every time I've watched the trailer. Of course, he could be just watering indoor plants. The watering can there in his hand though just keeps being like a loose thread I want to pull on...❤️✨️",7.2
Heretic,I bet this will be a reoccuring theme in the movie and a critique on the church in general. Like what the church says versus what their environment demonstrates.,7.2
Heretic,"And the picture of Hugh and his dog, instead of his ""wife""",7.2
Heretic,​ @Aquita17  usually a comment by the misinformed. But people choose to see things in the way they want to,7.2
Heretic,"@johngaudy  that's an interesting detail. I know the audience wasn't shown that photo for no reason. Unless, of course, Hugh Grant has a clause in his contract requiring at least one photo of him from his romcom era be prominently displayed in the film.",7.2
Heretic,These actions remind me of politicians appealing to what people want to believe.,7.2
Heretic,"His ""wife"" is probably somewhere in the House or not. 
What if it ends with his wife making pie?",7.2
Heretic,It seems that he's testing their faith by seeing how far he can string them along.,7.2
Heretic,Eeee! Love these observations and the discussion they've inspired! I'll be watching this film closely after this! <3,7.2
Heretic,"Maybe i profiled this guy but... The first thing i thought when he said his wife was home was, yeah shes home...shes present... Shes just not alive. He does do creepy vibes very well.",7.2
Heretic," justingary5322  yess!! i’m loving everyone’s observations sm! the trailer already says so much about them, i love picking it apart! 

it’s like they’re already establishing Sophie’s character (Sister Barnes) as apprehensive and questioning/observant of her environment, whereas Chloe’s character (Sister Paxton) is already accepting of her beliefs and circumstance. Sister Paxton is blindly prepared to enter the house when prompted when Sister Barnes stops and recalls that they can’t enter without another woman present- i think this entertains Grant’s character a bit, and of course his wife just so happens to be home, regardless if there’s evidence or not- upon hearing that there is in fact the promise of another woman being present, Sister Paxton eagerly enters the house promptly, Barnes in tow, following in the footsteps of a wholehearted believer. however she is still hesitant. 

from the moment the characters meet, to the realization that everything they had believed since they had entered the house was a lie; the roles the characters play in the story are so evident it makes me gush over the writing. 
when they realize they are trapped, Sister Barnes actively seeks a way out while Sister Paxton is seen almost in expectation that Grant’s character will return, like she has given up escaping because it is already established that they are trapped. when presenting the possibility of freeing themselves through the window, Paxton immediately shoots it down bc it’s simply “crazy” and surely not possible- because that is what she believes- we never see them try to escape through the window because there’s just “no way” they can make it out so they should just accept the idea that they are trapped. but they will never know because they never tried.

belief is such a great motif- especially for a psychological thriller!! the writing is just seeping with metaphors and symbolism and we’ve only been presented with a short trailer, yet there’s so much to dissect!! 

sorry for going all nerdy, i love finding people i can pick apart writing and movies with bc sometimes it’s just fun, yk? :)",7.2

Heretic,"@hugh-jasole  About 4 times. Yes, I absolutely do enjoy the process of discovering a movie. Actually, I got really lucky and, knowing there was a ridiculous amount of hype, managed to see Longlegs without even watching a trailer. I had to make a point to avoid it in the media but it was worth it.",7.2

Heretic,"@ i get that it’s an intentional device being employed by the movie, he basically explains as much, i’m just making a little joke based in the real world (though even in the movie i do think it would work better if he actually didn’t end up having indoor plants because then that would feel more like it was contradicting their environment. though i guess even the candle wasn’t in contradiction to their environment until they turn it around and read the label - so i think it’s not so much that there’s a contradiction but they have a belief system that acts as a lens through which they’re interpreting their experience and seems to validate it until further scrutiny, so i think keeping the plants but having them be fake could have actually worked well. but also i think the candle served to demonstrate that well enough, it’d have probably become redundant to include another example)",7.2

But it's one megalithic assumption to decide, on spec, that the creator of all existence is a human-like man with identical emotions and identical ideology on the role of duty, hierachy, fealty, sacrifice, shame, and punishment.

That is one massive leap indeed.",7.2
Heretic,"If you watch the trailer ​@EleiyaUmei  it's because the movies name is Heretic and.... the man in the movie played by HG is forcing the two proselytizing girls to CHOOSE.... so ... the etymology of the word is highly applicable to a discussion of the trailer....

Shurfs",7.2
Heretic," @VanessaNeiditch  I got that, thanks. But the comment makes this detail seem more significant than it actually is smh",7.2
Heretic," justingary5322 Evolution doesn’t happen over just a couple thousand years, it’s a long game of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years to millions of years. And you have provided no book titles (translations of course) where people can read of the Greek philosophers speaking about Christ which would be funny since he lived after most of the great Greek philosophers died.",7.2
Heretic," justingary5322  Awesome explanation and you use extra-biblical knowledge to prove biblical truths and knowledge! 🤩That is totally reasonable though people will say it's not, God gets the final say on it. Lol. 

Keep sharing because even the hardest hearted person who dislikes the idea of God needs to know they are LOVED by God. Jesus on earth was due to His LOVE of people, each of us. The Holy Spirit literally brings the LOVE of God into people who follow and believe in him... as a personal guide and friend.",7.2
Heretic," justingary5322  There is no perfect person including Christians but we LOVE a perfect God.  To non-believers don't let the imperfect people made by God put you off knowing the perfect creator God. 

Because our earliest ancestors used their free choice wrongly and didn't listen to God they were given consequences we all carry the evidence of it, but he cared and forgave them because they admitted their wrong. 

He has to be just like a good parent would be and repay us for breaking rules just as a parent or lawman has to. We don't get what we deserve because he sent a way to be cleared of all charges, and stand right with him again... through Jesus taking our charges onto his account and wiping the slate clean, though he NEVER deserved it. IF we accept him and believe that's who he is and what he did.",7.2
Heretic,"As an actual heretic, I can report that it wasn't my fellow Christians who put me off of ""god.""
It was actually the god himself.
Nasty little Bronze Age war deity who divorced his own Goddess, Ashera, and pretends to be the ""father and mother"" of all living things...
When all that he really wants is the smell of burning sacrifices.

0 out of 10, will not serve again.",7.2
Heretic," @NeonCrone-CLC  That's a shame. However you dislike him he doesn't feel that way about you. He loves you.

Regardless of our impression of him and why the bible says the last days are being delayed because he wants none to perish, meaning be without him in this world. If we die separated from him because we broke his commands then it will be horrible. 
He made a way to be restored through Jesus. Jesus didn't kill anyone. He let himself be killed as a criminal though he did not commit a crime. 

BUT it's free choice. To believe or not, follow or not. 

God said I don't want sacrifices but obedience and our only sacrifice is to give praise even when we don't feel like it for his goodness and things he has done. Which are hard to see when evil is decieving you and shows you only the bad things.",7.2
Heretic," @1970brenz   after serving the god of Christianity for almost 40 years, and seeking to know him, I was horrified by his character and his demands for sacrifice. 
I was reared to be a ""living sacrifice"" for this god. He was feeding on the horrible decisions I made in ""his name.""
So, let him try to do his worst to me.
I am not afraid of his ridiculous punishments. I have abandoned him because truly, I prefer the Outer Darkness to his company. I'm not the only one.",7.2
Heretic, justingary5322 drugs and blind piety is an ineffective combination. Try again.,7.2
Heretic,@rockjock3 That’s interesting that Heretic is rooted in the Ancient Greek word meaning “i choose”. Whereas the word “religion” is rooted in the Latin word “religare” which means “to bind”.,7.2
Heretic,​@leilanil3788  evolution is a theory. There is no proof that we evolved from fish or apes. Darwin regretted publishing his mistakes. We are created in God's image.,7.2
Heretic,"​​ @NeonCrone-CLC  the punishment is the separation from God for eternity, unless we repent our sins and accept Christ as our saviour. There is no sin that will improve your life, so he is a loving Father trying to lead us on a righteous path. It's very simple.",7.2

You're not old enough to remember him when Bridget Jones came out, and you know what I said when I saw him in that as a 23 year old in 2001? 'Man, Hugh Grant has aged!' Its all relative.",7.2

Heretic, @AshleyRich-p7m fuck yes. Me and my girl have been discussing it ever since we left the movies saw it last night. Its thought provoking. And keeps you on the edge.,7.2
Heretic,AHHHHHHH I’ve gotta see it again. But also because I was totally knocked off balance because the opening shot is literally the view I had from basically my backyard for 2 years. Literally the exact same angle. A weird moment for someone with PTSD who has flashbacks without literal flashbacks being forced on them. Took me a long time to get back into the movie afterwards. So it’ll be a win/win to see it again.,7.2

And get people to talk about their own relationship with Christ and try to relate. Its important to be as sincere and relatable as possible as an LDS missionary, and take no for an answer and feel the vibes people give you. I did a ton of service on my mission too, like picking weeds especially, and many people ended up appreciating us instead of avoiding us.",7.2
Heretic,"Whatever you think of the Latter-day Saint faith, major props for portaying the missionaries as actual human beings.",7.2
Heretic,"As a former Mormon who served a mission, it's interesting to see realistic portrayals of Mormon missionaries being used as more than the butt of a joke. I can see how the strict set of morals and being homesick could add a lot to the plot of a thriller.",7.2
Heretic,"My far-fetched theory: it’s a storyline similar to the Greek mythology about the Minotaur that resides in the middle of the labyrinth. Each year they would send in youths and maidens into the labyrinth as a sacrificial offering to the Minotaur (he eats them). 

This old guy seems like a mad scientist/inventor and maybe he somehow was able to reanimate his dead wife and she’s now like some zombie lady who needs to be trapped inside the maze he created. Her “resurrection from the dead” is why he said they’d witness a miracle. He sends in people into the maze to feed her. 

Hey man, like I said, far-fetched theory.",7.2

Heretic," @missollyk  He claims that there is pie in the oven but it was actually just candle, part of the trap. There was never a pie. The pie is a lie.",7.2
Heretic, @missollyk The candle was part of a trick to entice the missionaries to enter the house believing his wife was making pie when it's just a scented candle. It was ploy to trap them inside.,7.2
Heretic," @ElderStatesman  Thanks for spelling it out for the type of folks who cant find it within themselves to think about what they just watched seconds ago and put the context clues and pieces together in their head. I was about to but you beat me to it.

I'm used to those people. My brother is the type to ask questions every 2 mins in a movie and I'm tired of letting him know that  the answers to all his questions are literally on the screen if he ever finds it within himself to put the phone down and actually pay attention to the fucking movie :D",7.2

Heretic, @jasonwhitley8605 this trailer isn’t asking the viewer to build a super computer,7.2
Heretic,"​@ElderStatesman  I thought that was the case, but the candle wasnt lit. So how did the girl just assume he was lying and not really baking a pie? Maybe he really liked the scent.",7.2
Heretic, @missollyk He lit a blueberry scented candle to make it seem like a blueberry pie was baking. That his “wife” was baking a pie to lure them inside. Creepy.,7.2
Heretic,whats concerning is you should take consideration that one of these days you might needs there intake on something you dont know you should be concern about your own.,7.2
Heretic, @rachelhall9837 He probably blew it out. He just wanted the scent in the air.,7.2
Heretic, @CMV314 I get why people get mad. Because of how those who need everything to be spelled out for - movies are downgrading. I wish there were more movies that makes you think (I’m not talking about movies with open ending - those are awful),7.2
Heretic," @RockinGirlx93  My question: why do you care? I guarantee that no matter how smart you are, there's something you may have trouble understanding. Do you understand astrophysics? What about geometry? Or, neurosurgery? Imagine if a neurosurgeon criticized you because you don't understand his craft. That's exactly what you're doing. You're no smarter than anyone else.",7.2
Heretic, @IvansPersonal  That's my point: they need to get a bit of their own medicine. They're no smarter than anyone else.,7.2
Heretic,Right but did anyone notice the candle is lit when he sets it on the table and obviously at the end of the conversation the candle is blown out and the wax is hardened. So maybe there is no more blueberry pie smell when he gets up to go check it because the smell went away when the flame on the candle was extinguished,7.2
Heretic, @CMV314 Well Done ✔️. I too also thought that comment came across as unnecessary and belittling. Social media seems to attract so much negative traits in people. I don’t why but it does and it gives them a platform to unfortunately in many cases to be the worst version of themselves. Your response to that was EXCELLENT And you put it in a way that leaves no room for debate or criticism. Again well done 👍,7.2
Heretic," @celiamaness8856  I get that, but it could have been a little clearer. It was just a glimpse in a trailer though, so I definitely understand we may not have the whole picture. I was just saying that the scene wasn't as ""clear"" as it could have been. (e.g., if he just blew it out, why not show the smoke? If ""his wife"" was baking a pie in the kitchen, why is the candle in the living room?) The comment I was responding to made it sound like there was no good reason to be confused.  I'm still really excited to see this movie, though!",7.2
Heretic," @davidn.990  Are you talking about that exact brand? I have plenty of candles like this one around my house and I just don't agree. It's just a trailer scene though, so I'm fully aware I may not have the full picture. I'm just pointing out that it wasn't as crystal clear as the original comment made it seem.",7.2
Heretic,"My question is: how did he know to light the blueberry pie-scented candle? Did he expect company? Does he have a stock of pie-scented candles that he lights every day, just in case a future victim comes knocking at his door?",7.2

Heretic," @rachelhall9837  The candle was lit in earlier scenes, but it had died down (burnt out), if it helps!",7.2

Heretic,"⁠ @FreshSpecimens I don’t think it validates it, it more leaves it up for interpretation. That’s the thing about faith; it’s not something you can disprove or prove. Was the end a miracle or just a mere coincidence? We’ll never know. Both Hugh and Chloe’s characters are the extremes of their beliefs. What I did get from the movie, as creepy as the method was, that the middle ground is that we should always question what we’re told is “real” or “true” because things aren’t always as they seem. If you believe, fine, but keep digging. If you don’t believe, cool, but it’s also okay that others believe. And finally, women in religion are extremely easy prey for sick men. They ignored almost every sign of potential danger, yet still continued just to “win a soul.”",7.2

As members of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, we’re constantly told to study things out for ourselves, ask questions, study the scriptures for the answers, build your own testimony of Jesus Christ. What part of that sounds like mind control?",7.2
Heretic," @krystlebauer224  The part where you believe the lie of religion, base your entire life around it, and then believe you are ""questioning"".  Mind controlled refers to not only doing what others tell you, but believing what they tell you is true, that your ""conclusions"" are actually your own.

Look at the billions of people in the world who all ""know"" their false religions are absolutely true, look at how mind controlled they all are.  Then realize you are one of them.",7.2

Dallin Oaks and newly called historian Kyle McKay are telling students that research wasn’t the answer for a faith crisis.

You might feel empowered to study things out for yourself, but your top leaders time and time again have preached to stay away from unapproved sources, doubt your doubts, and stay in the boat.  Sounds like mind control to me.",7.2

Heretic," @HomestarJr I can see why that quote would be bothersome, it doesn’t sit right with me either. But to be fair, that quote was referring to hostile people, not just people with different views. The idea that it applies to non-believers generally is false, as the leaders work with and share ideas from people who don’t share our faith quite often.
It’s far too common for people to spin and misconstrue what we actually believe, and to pull people into that bias instead of just sharing information. So I think it means not to fall for the spin, and give an honest look at questions and concerns instead, which is totally fine.",7.2
Heretic," @HawkeyeVoid  I think the way you’ve interpreted it is healthy.  Not everyone does.  I don’t think you should have to do that with prophetic counsel.  It should be easily understood.

I listened to the talk as it was given.  I didn’t feel like it necessarily referred to hostile people only.  Do not take counsel from those who do not believe.  I don’t remember it being tied to hostility, just lack of belief.  Maybe I should reread it.  I haven’t heard a word from my believing family since general conference, so not everyone interpreted it the way you have.",7.2
Heretic," @JoeBuck-uc3bl  No, your strawman describes absolutely anyone.

Religion espouses tenets and beliefs that MUST be held as truth regardless of personal experience, regardless of reality, that cannot be questioned or altered or ignored.  Religion claims these tenets are ""facts"", claims they are timeless, claims they are supremely moral, and claims they are perfect, as well as usually ""divinely"" sourced.",7.2
Heretic," @JoeBuck-uc3bl  Yes it is. When you're goal is to paint it in a negative light rather than just a differing view on life. YES IT IS. Keep up or you just hate religion so you don't care. Also I'm not religious, but when you're painting religion in a negative light or as ""useless"" (which this film's twist is gonna be, don't just pray to survive, DO something etc.), then yes it is woke. It's just going: ""Eh, I don't believe a big invisible man in the sky created the existence, but you do you."" It's: ""This is dumb and oppressive and so are you for believing in it."" Keep up.",7.2
Heretic," @Aeroldoth3     Lol I straw manned nothing, you threw out a bogus definition of mind control that’s way too broad, which would ALSO refer to anyone who comes to believe in any worldview via much contemplation, and careful evaluation.   

“Believing that what someone tells you is true, and believing that your conclusions are actually your own” fits both groups of people, people who just believe things without analyzing them as well as people who land on a worldview after analyzing many of them.   Nobody at all didn’t first hear various worldview from other people who believed them…and then believe those other people…and then concluded for themself that said worldview sounds convincing.   

You’re mixing up the path one takes to reach their beliefs, with the actual beliefs that a person settles on.",7.2
Heretic,"​@judefan9991 Yeah had the same experience,  I told them to please not come back. Next day my truck was keyed...checked my security camera...sure enough these ""Crist like clowns"" are on video slicing and dicing my doors....",7.2
Heretic," @swankhood I doubt if you ever actually met one. The faith promotes questioning. In fact, it’s one of the cornerstone teachings that you are to seek out for yourself whether it is true, and does not encourage blind following. There are a lot of available resources if you are truly curious.",7.2
Heretic," @Aeroldoth3 ah, so you are saying look at you! I wonder how many things you take on faith?  It’s highly presumptuous to assume you are the intelligent one and everyone else is simply wrong.",7.2

Heretic," @HomestarJr it depends on the “counsel”. No, I won’t take counsel on hearing the spirit from someone who doesn’t believe. However, the 13tb article tells us that what is good we should seek after, regardless of the source, so yes, you either misunderstanding or misinterpreting.",7.2
Heretic, @abehambino  the 12th article of faith talks about complying with the law.  Your church is suing several small cities who don’t want ginormous temples in their quiet neighborhoods and fighting zoning laws.  Quit cherry picking articles of faith you follow.,7.2
Heretic," @abehambino  
1) I try to take as little on ""faith"" as possible.  I always consider I might be wrong on something and question my beliefs when encountering new info.  If only theists did the same.

2) Never said I was the intelligent one.",7.2
Heretic,"​ @JoeBuck-uc3bl  Yes, you did strawman.  You ignored the first half of the paragraph as well as the beginning of the sentence you quote:

""Mind controlled refers to not only doing what others tell you, ""

Do all beliefs, ideologies and positions involve doing what others tell you?  Do they involve ignoring evidence and personal experiences to believe lies?

The vast majority of religious people in the world ascribe to the religion they were indoctrinated into, the one they grew up with.  While there are certainly people who adopt a faith different from the one of their culture, they are a tiny fraction of the whole.  

Most theists have never truly examined their religion, truly questioned the tenets and teachings, never challenged the morality of their ""gods"".

The ""path"" to their faith was to be indoctrinated into it as children, before they had really learned to think at all, let alone think critically.  That is neither respectable nor admirable, and it sure as hell isn't equivalent to an adult developing morals and a view on life based on their life experiences.

The average person isn't blowing up buildings, killing gays or ""purifying"" humanity due to their ""blasphemies"" and ""sins"".",7.2
Heretic," @Aeroldoth3  If you really studied religions you would find out how much in common they all have. And are full of really simple truths that you should live by if you want to have a good life. Its like a map for a good life - and of course you can reject it and think you have all the knowledge and you are wise enough to find your own way of life. In doing so you will only, eventually came to same conclusions. Or have a though life :D So feel free experimenting, going round and round to finally anyways find the same, simple truths.",7.2
Heretic," @swankhood  It always baffles me - all that horror stories about LDS. I am in church for nearly 20 years and I am yet to see all that ""control"", ""manipulation"", ""harm"", and all the internet boo hoo legends :D You do you of course, I cant help myself but laugh at most of these stories. My favorite one is the video on YT where ex-LDS says literally how ""Jesus didnt paid his bills"". I mean.. yeah. What can you do but laugh :D",7.2
Heretic, @mt.shasta6097  The funny part - LDS for quite some time now cant just go to knock doors. Also - when is the last time you had JWs knock your door? I see them standing on the streets but the knocking part is of the past. Yet people still talk about it like it was happening.,7.2
Heretic, @JoeBuck-uc3bl  so show me woke people that are religious then ;),7.2
Heretic," @tlilmiztli  if I can’t, that doesn’t mean that woke is a synonym for anti-religious.   I’m sure that many people would label alcoholics as irresponsible…yet it doesn’t follow that alcoholism is then synonymous with being irresponsible.  In practice, many terms have major overlap, yet that doesn’t mean that they aren’t defined differently.   Obviously many forms of being irresponsible have nothing to do with being an alcoholic, yet it’s not hard to imagine someone making an argument that you can’t really have a “Responsible Alcoholic”. But that doesn’t make alcoholism synonymous with irresponsibility.   Likewise, many forms of being non-religious are not synonymous with being woke.   There are a lot of anti-religious people who lash out at both religions, and at wokeness.",7.2
Heretic,"​ @tlilmiztli  All religions say very different things, suggest different behaviors, and do so for different reasons.

If you pick and choose only what you want from each religion, and generalize them still further, then yes you can get ""basic"" truths.  And yes, you can get those same basic truths without religions.  You certainly don't need religion to tell you not to harm others.

The problem with religions is ALL the other baggage that goes with each one.  And the assertion that only they have THE truth about reality.  AND that followers can push their religion on others, on all the world, to make it a ""better"" place.  And that everyone will just love that soooooooo much.

Thus we have religious wars.  Thus we have oppression and persecution.  Thus we have laws and customs and beliefs condemning ""those"" people and that they need to be stopped.

People can be good without religion, good without ""divine"" mandates, and good to each other.  I would say people can be FAR better than religion allows them to be, and the big difference is I make no effort to impose by ""superior"" views on anyone.  I'm not enslaving blacks, raping women, torturing and experimenting on gays, or incinerating jews.

So no, I will NEVER come to the same conclusions as religions, as I'm not about mind controlling others.",7.2
Heretic,​ @krystlebauer224  As a recovering Mormon I used to make the same claims as you have made in your comment..  I now understand all of those exhausting mental gymnastics to be a classic example of cognitive dissonance.,7.2
Heretic,"​ @jeffii9890  Yes, it is bothering people.  It's selfish & it's arrogant to walk onto private property, uninvited, & insert yourself into the homeowner's life.  If we want to know more about what you're selling we'll come to you.",7.2
Heretic,"​ @CaledonianCloud  Also in an ideal world, uninvited strangers don't knock on your door & interrupt your day trying to sell you something.
It's called respect & common courtesy.",7.2
Heretic," @lynnpetersen-ig1ox  But…they don’t sell anything. They literally just knock, ask if you’re interested, and then go if you say no. Even with salespeople (non-religious), I understand why they’re there and don’t have a problem with it. Just be decent and people are decent back. Never had an issue with religious folk at my door. If you have an issue with the religion, that’s a different thing. But just turning up? I dont mind at all because they’ve always been respectful.",7.2

I don't go knock on your door and tell you that what you believe isn't the truth.  Also, ""no soliciting"" signs apply to missionaries, too. Don't knock on my door if you haven't been invited.",7.2
Heretic, @dalethompsonjr.9849  I would have shared that video far and wide. I hope you called police and pressed charges.,7.2
Heretic," @MsUnknown300  No, I'm good. I'll keep doing what Jesus asked me to do. And no, no soliciting DOESN'T apply to missionaries. We went all the way to the Supreme Court to fight that. If we aren't asking for you to give us something in exchange for money, we aren't soliciting a thing. 

Next time we knock, answer. Tell us to not comeback, and we'll put your address on a list and you'll never see us again. Even if you rudely tell us, we'll make sure the entire congregation honors your wishes. Have a blessed day.",7.2

You do realize people move into other houses right?  Meaning if missionaries knock on a door a year ago, a new family quite possibly moved into that home within that year.

Mind blown, right?",7.2
Heretic,"​ @Aeroldoth3 you are hilarious.  I bet you believe the LDS church in hemorrhaging members as well right?

Well what is it? Are we losing members left and right or do we use mind control to keep members?  It can't be both.  If we use mind control yet are losing members in droves, we must not be very good (or even slightly good) at this whole mind control thing. 😂😂😂",7.2
Heretic, @swarlesbarkely2449  I said nothing about gaining or losing members.... don't know what you're on about...,7.2
Heretic," @Aeroldoth3  I know you didn't.  I never said that you did.  I did say that I bet you think that.  Tell me the truth,  you do believe that right.  I mean,  you didn't deny it in your reply so I can only conclude that you do.  I brought it up to prove the point over your conspiracy theory of mind control.  You can reread it if you want.  It all makes sense.  I'm not to sure what you're confused about. 🤷",7.2
Heretic,"@swarlesbarkely2449  No. I have no thoughts on what the gain/loss ratio is for any particular religion.  It's irrelevant so I never think about it.  If a religion gains followers that doesn't prove it's true or good, and if a religion loses people that doesn't prove it's false or evil.  Numbers are meaningless here... argumentum ad numerum.

My assertion about mind control is not about LDS specifically.  It's about the corrupting and manipulative nature about religions as a whole.  Religions generally oppose critical thinking, deep analysis and contrasting theologies.  They support credulity, naivete and blind acceptance from authorities.  They do not create wise and enlightened citizens of the world but rather judgemental, closeminded, and arrogant bigots who have blindly accepted their indoctrination as fact and work to force that indoctrination on others... for their own good.  The billions who have suffered from religious persecution and religious violence are testament to that.

I support morality and want ALL humans to be better people... to be the best they can be.  That REQUIRES the ability to think critically, to have a moral system not a moral code, and the freedom to update any view or belief when new information comes along.  Religion ACTIVELY opposes that.  

Religion holds humanity back in countless ways, which is why I call it mind control, why I call it evil, and why I oppose it.",7.2

Heretic," @mainHERO88  Yeah, because it's a recent thing that's why I said ""BECOMING."" Do you know what that word means? BECOMING, means it wasn't like that before. I like the Lighthouse for example, not woke AT ALL. Unless those weird reviews that claim it's about sexual dominance or some $hit are correct, then fxck that film. But pretty sure it's not and more just a mythology horror tale/fate of guilt and punishment. I wanna say it started at... Let me look at the list of their releases in order... 

A part of me wants to say MAYBE it started at Ex Machina because the ai is female and I remember LOOONG time ago dead channel (because of hilarious female insanity drama) Geek Remix's channel mentioning much she loved how feminist the film was. Like a woman being oppressed by men escaping to be free etc. That endless ironically sexist trope in media. 

But it REALLY start with The VVitch. To allow you to put on the media literacy glasses... It's another subtle story of female ""oppression"" and ""liberation."" Lead is treated like trash by the whole family, one by one killed off until she's eventually free to join the coven of witches that killed her family, even the infant. Because pro-abortion or anti-motherhood messaging as well...

Then Remember, Krisha and Green Room. One about another ""oppressed"" woman and two about ""Muh WW2 bad guys."" Throwing in the Lobster because it's post-modern cringe normie nihilism about dating. Swiss Army Man I'm throwing in because about mentally ill loner man stalking his ex with a dead body... Like... Whatever... Next, Equal, which is more post-modern normie dating nihilism mixture with Equilibrium. ""MUH FEELINGS! MUH PRECIOUS FEELINGS!"" Cringe. Next, I THINK Into the Forrest might be SOME social justice allegory involving gender politics. Don't know didn't see it, don't are too because 8/10 I bet I'm dead right. Next... OH $HIT, I take it back, THIS was the major turning point, Moonlight (should've have to explain). This is where it started to get SJW and woke, 2016 because Trump was elected and leftists brainrot panicking of like death squads and camps lol. So the messaging in media ramped up and it wasn't just A24. Next, 20th century women... Next I'm just gonna list the rest: The Blackcoat's Daughter, The Lovers (dear god, DEAR GOD!), The Exception, It comes at night, A Ghost Story (WHAT IN THE HOLY FXCK OF SHEER NIHILISTIC DEPRESSING TRASH WAS THAT!?), Lady Bird (btw I'm skipping a good amount because I've never seen them so I'm not sure, but not doubt I'm passing up more examples of woke trash), First Reformed, Woman Walks Ahead, The Children Act, The Souvenir, The Last Black Man in San Francisco, Midsommar, Skin, Share, The Kill Team, Boys State (directed by two women, so 100% gender commentary on their own solipsistic feminist/sexist views of men), On the Rocks, False Positive, Zola, The Souvenir Part II, X (and the two other films, new one MaXXXine to finish the trilogy), Everything Everywhere All at Once (BTW I know not all of these are horror, so then just cringe post-modern woke normie media period), MEN (FXCK THIS FILM!), Bodies Bodies Bodies (pure cancer), Instinct, God's Creatures, The Inspection, White Noise, Close, The Whale, This Place Rules (let's just forget the period of 4 months when people rioted over a dude having an overdose lol), When You Finish Saving The World, Beau is Afraid, You Hurt My Feelings, Earth Mama, Stop Making Sense (as post-modern as you can get, where literally nothing matters because millennials are deluded freaks that hate existence), All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt, Dream Scenario, The Zone of Interest, Problemista, Love Lies Bleeding, Civil War, I Saw The TV Glow (not out yet, but from ALL the trailers I've seen I can tell it's gonna be a trans allegory film), The Sixth (more ORANGE MAN BAD!), And now the Front Room and Heretic. And there's more here I don't know... Let's see... We Live in Time sounds like more relationship nihilism... Babygirl sounds like lesbian workplace sexual harassment double standard romance. And there's more to be release in 2024 and YET to be announced that don't have summaries. So yeah... Woke trash.",7.2
Heretic," @mainHERO88  Also I'd just to point out that MOST of the names for these films are fxcking stupid too lol. SOME make sense like The Lighthouse. Simple, to the point.

These others because the film is so post-modern abstract in whatever it's trying to express; have to come up with the dumbest names possible to encompass the film in one title lol. 

Will say I didn't know A24 did the Iron Claw. I like the Iron Claw purely because I'm a wrestling fans. Not perfect, they leave out A LOT (like another Von Erich brother) and the Ric Flair they got was HORRIBLE lol, but I liked it non the less. Tale in wrestling lore I was unaware of with WCCW and the Von Erich's massive contribution to pro-wresting in America. And that title makes sense because it's their dad's/their finisher of the submission hold. 

Also another than The Lighthouse being perfect dark psychology/possibly mythological horror comedy about madness and The Iron Claw because pro-wrestling is awesome... Most the films are post-modern nihilistic garbage about life lol. And I know they're not the only studio, like the studio did A Knock At The Cabin or the other film with Ethan Hawk about lacking information on what's happening I think as America is being attacked? Yeah, it's just become: ""Life and people suck, right? Nothing matters."" I mean TRUE, but it's a weird message for these same people to be pushing if they want blind progress in society lol. Like that's not progression when nothing you do matters, that's anarchy lol. That's the Purge night, unless they want that.",7.2

Heretic," @TheLuchaDork  that doesn’t make sense to me, missionaries are known for being everywhere and many MANY movies and tv shows have filmed in Utah and they have a tax incentive program to make it a good option for film. It can be set where ever they want. Also, missionaries don’t really go door to door in Utah like they do other places because there are so many latter-day saints, they get tons of referrals and have people to go with them almost all the time making it much harder for them to end up in a situation like this. They don’t have bikes here either, too big of areas. I would argue if the writers know anything about missionaries in Utah, they would not set it here.",7.2

Heretic," @hang1893  I don’t. But given that he was a straight up movie star back in the day, it’s a fairly educated guess that he was getting paid more at that time. He got 7.5 mil for Notting Hill, and I don’t think any of his contracts lately have come close to that figure",7.2
Heretic," @justmejenny7986  he was in a lot of big movies, but as an actor, I didn’t really see him take the creative swings he’s been taking lately. He was always just the ever charming Hugh Grant. Lately he’s played a variety of characters to perfection, many of which are against the type he played during his movie star run. I’ll give more credit to About a Boy tho, cause that performance was very good!",7.2
Heretic, @greens294  and that was 1999 dollars today that would be about $15 million. I'm sure he's getting paid six figures as his name has value alone but like other stars in these smaller budgets he might be getting a piece of the gross.,7.2
Heretic, @greens294  hes been consistent for the past few decades.. how you think that would make his pay go DOWN is beyond me.,7.2
Heretic,I think he just got the point where he can have fun.,7.2
Heretic," @hang1893  you get paid more in the leading role than you do in a supporting one. Kinda common knowledge. He was getting paid 7-10 million per film for a 10 year period. Then he slowed down in the mid 2000s, and has since been playing mostly supporting roles that are more interesting than his earlier leading ones. Even though he’s the lead in this instance, I have a feeling the entire budget for this film barely exceeds the 10 mil he used to get on a regular basis
He’s not strapped for cash obviously, he’s a legend. Just saying it was different 20 years ago, when he was less of a thespian, and more straight up movie star",7.2
Heretic, @greens294  You dont know what your talking about. And you stil acting like you do.,7.2

Just generic romance movies with a pretty boy in the male lead role. His newer roles are way more interesting and diverse.",7.2

Heretic," @PixelatedFaerie  I wouldn't say Blumhouse is trash, just that Blumhouse puts out mostly trash. Sweetheart, Totally Killer and Hush were all quite good. In fact, all of Mike Flanagan's films from Blumhouse are pretty good. But I would say maybe 10% of their films are bangers, 50% are mediocre at best, and 40% are baaaad.",7.2

Heretic,people act like everything they touch turns to gold. yet lots of shit comes out of the studio. all they do is produce stuff... they have no relation to the creative process other than that. I have been disappointed plenty by A24. Anyone who praises them like this is an edgelord who fancies themselves a movie critic,7.2
Heretic," @dizzlegrizzle1919  Pretty solid ratio though. Cool title, I’ll take it. I get most of my critique practice by volunteering for the local film festival in town and screening films 8 months out of the year. Certainly not all gems but, gotta support the small film scene we do have and help it grow. Not gatekeeping film and critiques is a major part of its success.",7.2

Heretic," @JustinZarian these other sarcastic comments replying to you are just strange. 
I totally agree with you. Took me by total surprise. Best 2 years was great. Errand of angels was decent.
As long as the movie doesn’t take shots at the churches expense I’m all for this! Hugh grant is great for this role and I doubt he’d take a role I’ll natured especially with 2 sister missionaries.",7.2
Heretic," @kellyjohnson4578  I take it in stride. Thank you for your comment

And yes, I consider The Best Two Years the best LDS made film for showing at least a more grounded depiction of LDS characters that challenges the characters but doesn’t need to degrade them. You can have stories of LDS losing their faith, but you can also have stories where people struggle but keep to their principles. I appreciate seeing that with characters of other faiths too, since it speaks to personal characteristics just as much as spiritual. And it’s the least goofy LDS movie aside from Richard Dutcher’s movies, which is saying a lot with how many LDS films are cornier than Iowa!",7.2
Heretic," @kellyjohnson4578 If by ""taking shots at the churches expense"" you mean exposing how cults indoctrinate people (especially young impressionable kids), then that's exactly what the film needs to do. It's an important message",7.2
Heretic,​ @brettjohnson536  I think it'd be a bit strange to do so if the main characters are in the religion. Def wouldn't make sense if you wanted the audience to care about them,7.2

OMFG... Here we go... Despot of Atrium's review on Barbie perfectly explains the dying of toxic ideological marketing. With how Barbie was marketed up until near it's release, there was not ONE piece of marketing that hinted at the films broken and incorrect gender commentary. I honestly thought it was just gonna be a stupid live-action Barbie film. Like okay, cool whatever, how EVERYONE anti-woke first thought of the film. THEN as it got closer to release is when the ""Everything men do in your world, we do in ours"" trailers were being release and the ""She's everything, he's just Ken"" tagline was released and the final nail in the coffin for me was the internet with Greta and Robbie where Mattel walked by their comments it was a feminist film. I VIVIDLY remember the marketing of this film because it's the bane of my existence (metaphorically as a being in existence and literally as a man) and has actually made me hate the color pink a bit. Used to be like a top 5 color for me because I relate it to the cosmos or cosmic horror like Lovecraft's ""Color out of space."" THAT'S the color I thought when I firs read the story, no joke. After Barbie, it's top 50 lol. 

After Barbie, studios have learned they can't drive away half the paying audience by their ideological views right in the trailer. They need to trick them in like they used to. So the OUT-RIGHT telling you of the film's leanings in the trailer are over. But this side of the internet/life have gotten so used to the woke media and seen so many trailers and media just getting more lazy/predictable, I can pick up on the leanings now with how little they show. 

ONCE AGAIN, the twist of this film is ""Religion is stupid. Don't just pray, survive. You ladies got the right idea, not kill me, wahmen power, no more religious oppression!"" Just giving predication for Jackman's character's motivations. And I'll add it: ""Muh wife and child died in child birth because they didn't believe in C-SECTIONS! The other evil mans, they just want to oppress the wahmens with da religions. I'm so sorry ladies, and I'm sorry for being born mans."" Or something to that effect, watch. 

Just like ""I Saw The TV Glow"" is a trans allegory, watch. Calling it RIGHT NOW for both and even The Front Room. Some racism BS, expect they messed and literally placed the racism bit in the trailer and had a feeling it was going there lol. It's all predictable lol.",7.2

Heretic,​ @LtJackStone idk X is another recent a24 movie and there's a televangelist subplot/cuts of sermons but it's never really antagonistic imo. I think writers are starting to take less of an biased/malicious stance with their religion linked characters ie. Less comedic moments etc,7.2

Heretic,mayby they will be nice to the church and don't mention all of the scandals 🤞,7.2

Heretic,"@Mspisascam .. It shows that you never achieved any discipline in yourself. It's not about control, and you don't need to relate it to a church to talk about being better—better people, with better attitudes, being better in our own home, knowing how to listen, forgive, etc. In church, it's not about control; they motivate you to live higher standards. But for people who are not willing to make personal sacrifices, they will never know the blessings and personal and family progress.",7.2

2nd Book of Nephi, Chapter 26: Verse №10 - ""For the reward of their pride and their foolishness they shall reap destruction."" 

Assuming (1) that you'll always have strength because you had it in the past and (2) that you can be ensconced in and surrounded by a world of demographic decline and alienating individualism without being effected by it are both faulty reasonings predicated on wishful thinking and historical ignorance.

Pride cometh before the fall, Herr Lichtenstein. Every empire and religious sect before you has thought as you do and all of their domains have fallen or are crumbling. Before you assert that you have God on your side, remember that they thought the exact same thing, too. Arrogance from sanctimony and destiny is still arrogance.",7.2

Sad, I actually kinda adore them; the same way and for the same reason most people enjoy dogs. They've believe in a simple vision like kids do with Santa and are always happy, too pure and lovable. Not all of them but, the real believers are like puppies and, misguided though they may be, you can feel their love for you and hope you get into the ""highest degree of the celestial kingdom"". I invite them in and let them teach as though I were never a member of the Church and their hope is like a warm blanket for the soul. I feel good waving at them and taking their missionaries out for dinner given they live on a very lean, fixed income.",7.2
Heretic," @SpOculus33  That’s members, not active members. Sadly activity rate is probably 50% at best.",7.2
Heretic," @SpOculus33  No, it's not what you said. You said 17.2 million active members. I meant what I said, members in the records. The active members are a part of those members",7.2
Heretic," @giuliom3564  now your just splitting hairs, nitpicking… actually I see the members on record vs the active members as the same thing! 
We don’t know what the inactive members are going through in their lives. I’d bet that the majority of them still believe in their testimony and consider themselves LDS. 
The point is, is they’ve been baptized and they ARE on record. 
Quibbling over minutiae here… I’m sure the Lord still considers them as a member of His Church even though they aren’t attending every Sunday.",7.2
Heretic,"Just read an article about this movie, and I was thinking the same thing when I watched it lol. Definitely wanna make sure there is another woman in the house, and having been a missionary who didn't answer the phone because we were in the middle of nowhere with no service for an hour, I know for a fact that the district leader and maybe even the mission president would have been already looking for them. 

The article said that the two girls playing the sisters were raised in the church even though they themselves aren't practicing anymore, so hopefully things go well.",7.2
Heretic, @SpOculus33  So it's wrong to say active members. To be on records does not mean much. It's more correct to say simply members,7.2
Heretic," @giuliom3564  Are you a member? Are you active? If so then ask God if it’s wrong, not me!
I’ve said my opinion, I’m done arguing!",7.2
Heretic," @ashborn7343  with all respect to your question, the Truth that the LDS “Church” teaches a Doctrine that is Not of or from Jesus Christ.  Which I have Always found Ironically hilarious because since 1838 the LDS “church” is Literally named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  I do not say this to be of disrespect. I do say it because LDS doctrine teaches  a different gospel than what is taught in The Bible.  If you would like to have a one on one respectful Adult discussion about what I have posted here I am very willing.  It is my desire, as has been for near 35 yrs, to help others learn (if they are willing) who Jesus of The Bible is.  I look forward to a response.  And May God/Jesus/Holy Spirit bless you.",7.2
Heretic," @giuliom3564  baptized and named on record, they are still in the book of life, that is recorded in heaven! I think that’s the point! In Gods eyes they are members… clearly you aren’t",7.2
Heretic,"Yes, lets be so kind to a church. One who knew about the severe child sex abuse case in Bisbee, AZ. Cover up for the predator. Use the billions of dollars to make sure the Mormon church is protected and not held responsible for not getting authorities involved. When these poor kids are living a nightmare and not being helped. How anyone can support and still be a paet if that religion with knowing this information,  really astounds me.",7.2
Heretic," @thedirtytruth66  you must not watch any movies, shows, or popular music. The media has also allowed and protected abuse. So I hope you're not a hypocrite and still support those institutions with your money and time. 

I doubt it though. People who make these arguments couldn't care less about abuse of children, they're  just prejudice against religion.",7.2
Heretic," @HotKooks They are your own. You’ll lose control of these things through worldly influences, not believing in Christ and helping others.",7.2
Heretic," @jwn3497  So tell ""truths"" about my faith in a way that entertains the audience? That humiliates and demeans LDS people? They already did that Broadway and it won a Tony for ""Best Musical"" in 2011. Total bull $hit that my faith is portrayed in too ""nice"" a way.",7.2
Heretic,"I have a very low opinion of all religion, believe what you will - just don't drag me into your bullshit.  That said, earlier this summer I was washing my car and the sun had just gone down.  I was in the process of drying my car off and seemingly out of nowhere there were two attractive girls in dresses standing just behind my car. A half hour later they were on their way home smiling and waving, and I had just met two of the most genuinely sweetest girls I've ever met. They were Mormon gals on mission.  That was easily the best , and most down to earth experience I've had with people of faith.  Non judging,  kind and respectful and a great sense of humor .  I wish them both a wonderful life.",7.2
Heretic," @daniellichtenstein7541  hey buddy, is Lichtenstein, your last name?   If so, what a cool last name ! 😎",7.2
Heretic,I saw it already and it actually addresses all three of those things quite well in the movie,7.2
Heretic,"i'm not LDS but did door knocking in another faith, and we'd never have gone in the house.",7.2
Heretic,"Hugh Grant just must be loving these new, darker roles. He is so self deprecating, I hope he knows how much pleasure he brings with his work",7.2
Heretic,saw it yesterday and it was brilliant i did not see any preview of anything online so it was a nice surprise to see it i love A24,7.2
Heretic,I love it when older actors who were famous when they were young reinvent themselves and become cool again for everyone to enjoy. Hugh Grant in this film is unexpected and fresh.💗,7.2
Heretic,Who remembers Hugh Grant in the film 'Cloud Atlas' where he played the part of a terribly cruel  man? He said later that he'd really enjoyed being a 'baddie' for once. He was good...very good. 🤩,7.2
Heretic,If you've seen the film you'll know why he's holding a watering can in his hand as he opens the front door and greets the two girls - we learn what the watering can is all about later in the film.,7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant is just fantastic in these darker roles. When I first saw him as the villain in Paddington 2 my heart skipped a beat lol. Just brilliant,7.2
Heretic,I like how they accurately depicted the mission rule that a person of the same gender must be present in the home. I hope they are just as accurate with the rest of their depictions of missionaries.,7.2
Heretic,This movie was amazing. So many turns it kept me guessing. All the actors did a great job. I wouldn't be surprised if we see Hugh Grant getting some nominations this year.,7.2
Heretic,I served a mission and a few of us told a fake story about getting trapped in a killer's house. This definitely reminds me of that 😅,7.2
Heretic,"I LOVE how he says “Do not be afraid,” in this context. If you think about it a bit, it might be read as him mimicking (or possibly BEING) God, (Be not afraid) and literally testing them, like he does all the time in the bible. This looks freaking cool!",7.2
Heretic,That house goes in the tracting log as Do not Contact,7.2
Heretic,"Fabulous movie. They sustained the creep factor throughout as the film carried out the character's message to a tee. It had several codas inside the one plot to reignite our interest, with a few well-placed ideas inserted within. But on that note, the audience will recognize another movie having that same setup. I won't give away which one. Very nicely done.",7.2
Heretic,As someone bakes and has dessert scented candles…my ass would’ve thought he lit it to make more than the kitchen smell like pie 💀,7.2
Heretic,Love the juxtaposition between the warm and cozy color grading in some scenes versus the impending doom. My favorite.,7.2
Heretic,"Just the shot of the candle saying ""blueberry pie"" and the atmospheric music already makes this a must see! A24 never dissapoints!",7.2
Heretic,"As SOON as the young Lady had that look on her face, I said out loud: ""GET OUT!!"" 
I can't wait for this, with a very refreshing role for Hugh Grant!",7.2
Heretic,"Wow Hugh has outdone himself in range&variety, acting wise. Looking forward to joining Hugh in a moment in time descending into madness, for entertainment purposes. Looks like a great film.",7.2
Heretic,"When I once did pizza delivery, I was always told to never enter anyone's home even if they gave you permission to do so (for security reasons).  I was going to say, entering the house only if a woman is inside is a pretty stupid reason to feel safe.  But if they had declined, the credits would roll too quickly.",7.2
Heretic,I’m curious but I’d be surprised if there’s anything interesting. These movies typically portray the religious in two ways and neither are good. Ironically it’s a familiar theme to the faithful and a pacifier to the non-believers. Nothing new or interesting about it. But maybe I’ll be proven wrong this time.,7.2
Heretic,I’m assuming this is rated R so aren’t you not allowed to watch it?,7.2
Heretic,"Finally, a movie that accurately depicts the horrors of serving a mission.",7.2
Heretic," @memesouls8653 nothing explicitly states Mormons can’t watch R-rated movies, it’s just something lots of them avoid cause they think it’ll be bad for them or whatever",7.2
Heretic,"Back in the 80s-90s, the For the Strength of Youth pamphlet explicitly said to avoid R rated movies.",7.2
Heretic, @glazeandscumble I woke up today and realized it’s the year 2024.,7.2
Heretic," @YOHONOMOTO  2024 it may be, but millions of Mormons a little older than you grew up with a Mormonism that was very different from Mormonism today. Very different.",7.2
Heretic," @glazeandscumble  As an ex-Jehovah's Witness, I've noticed that over the years these kinds of cults-- I mean, religions, are starting to wake up and realize how closed-minded and off-putting (and thus, unattractive) their beliefs are, so they begin to ever-so-slowly open up towards newer generations and ways of thinking. Not enough so, in my opinion, but just enough to be a tad more ""palatable"" (but, again, still closed-minded enough that an enllightened person realizes they still have a long way to go).",7.2
Heretic,"I do! I've always had a soft spot for him, especially as a baddie 🥰",7.2
Heretic,"Me too. Stuff like heavy top down pushing for lessons taught, church attendance, baptisms, etc.",7.2
Heretic, @gm6856  ooh! I wonder if the movie will depict baseball baptisms! Now THERE'S an efficient tactic at raising those stats! Though I don't know if I've ever heard of sisters doing that so probably won't be in the film.,7.2
Heretic, @imustremaincivil2932  I suppose you prefer missionaries being depicted as the butt of a joke instead of the earnest and honest endeavor most of us in the Church actually see it as.,7.2
Heretic, @drakemiller2267  my issues are more with the institutional leadership than the individual membership or the missionaries on the ground. They are operating on what their leaders have told them. I do not want missionaries treated as jokes. I think they're being exploited.,7.2
Heretic, @imustremaincivil2932  well it’s okay to feel that way but for me I had a wonderful experience of my own volition and I’m grateful for the beliefs that I hold that have brought me peace and purpose even if our leaders aren’t perfect past or present.,7.2
Heretic,"My hope is because they want to appeal to most Christians, they will keep the talks centered on Christ as they did in the trailer, I imagine it will stay accurate if they do that rather than writing about some fringe elements they don’t understand. None of the writers seem to have associations with the church as either a member or former member so hopefully we have only been picked as an example to represent Christians in general rather than to send a specific message about us. It would be nice to not be the butt of the joke for once.",7.2
Heretic,"It was impressively accurate, I saw it this weekend and I’ve served a mission",7.2
Heretic, @jaromchristensen5598  I just saw it Monday. They got a lot right but plenty wrong like the reincarnation and birth control stuff.,7.2
Heretic," @drakemiller2267  I’d say it’s of course not normal for a missionary to have the birth control implant but it’s def possible, she could have had that implanted before the mission and she was already portrayed as a less “typical” by-the-book Mormon. That’s actually one way I think they accurately portrayed the characters, they weren’t just naive charicatures of what people think Mormon missionaries would be, but more complex and nuanced people who have their own reasons for their faith and way that they believe.",7.2
Heretic,There  is that movie based  on a true story.  Where the two elders  get kidnapped  and ransomed in Russia.,7.2
Heretic," @stockpilethomas7900  Being a Member myself, we all know how that one ended up....whats the agenda behind this one tho?",7.2
Heretic,@tenorsoul87   Maybe  one of the characters  loses  faith in the end but survives  and leaves  the church and then becomes like the Hugh   Grunt character.,7.2
Heretic,There's some truth to those stories. Look up Robert Elmer Kleason.,7.2
Heretic,"As a former missionary for the church, I had some very actual weird stuff like this happen to me.",7.2
Heretic,Went and saw this in the cinema the other day and it is genuinely incredible,7.2
Heretic,"""The Air that I Breathe"" is now officially a song associated with psychopathic engineer.",7.2
Heretic,"so many amazing clues/details in the first part of the trailer - him with the watering can despite it raining, obviously the candle, I suspect the framing of the girls in each shot foreshadows their fates … love it",7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant as a villain is a brilliant career move by him. He plays these roles so well.,7.2
Heretic,It’s clearly evident that thanks to this and the gentlemen Hugh grant needs to be given more roles as unhinged characters.,7.2
Heretic,Very glad Hugh Grant is getting something like this after a lot of campy villian roles (this years Unfrosted being a particular low point) He’s terrific in stuff like that but it’l be cool to see him flex his drama muscles as a real threat,7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant from romantic to scary villain. what a great actor,7.2
Heretic,The moment she realized there was no damn pie! She knew they were in trouble.  Can’t wait to see it !,7.2
Heretic,Old school trailer. Give me intrigue without giving everything away. A fine art.,7.2
Heretic,"Damn, A24 keeps making them and I keep watching them. Best movies currently available",7.2
Heretic,The fact that I had missionaries  over at my house not even an hour ago...,7.2
Heretic,Amazing movie. Had to come here to recommend it. I usually say every new movie is crap nowadays but this one was refreshing. We need more of this.,7.2
Heretic,"I served a mission for the church back in 2015 and I must say I always felt protected and if I did run into crazy people… I felt the spirit warn my not to even go into
Their house",7.2
Heretic,I have never seen Hugh Grant take on a role so chilling and creepy. This looks like it’s going to be another jackpot for A24!,7.2
Heretic,"I think they deliberately chose the same song that was used for the Saw X trailer (The air that I breathe by The Hollies), given that this film also features someone using traps/escape rooms. Can't wait for the film, A24 almost always delivers",7.2
Heretic,"The whole cast knocked it out of the park, and Hugh Grant didn't just sign on to try his hand at being creepy and collect a paycheck. Half the lines in this script are his monologues, and you can't afford to miss any of them. It was an inspired choice to have someone so casually charming play this role. How do you read someone who's always lying?

The young ladies did what I thought was impossible in the first ten minutes. They made me sympathize for religious solicitors. They feel like real people. Not perfect in any way, but you want them to be alright. No one deserves to be treated this way.",7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant is brilliant at being creepy - it's opened another door to his acting skills.,7.2
Heretic,"As long as missionaries are careful, many strange situations can’t be avoided. I didn’t experience anything too crazy, but it can happen.",7.2
Heretic,"Drunk guys following us with guns. Kids throwing rocks at us. Sitting in a kitchen with a drunk man (believing that his sober brother was home) where the only light was a single candle on the table, and then he set a knife on the table (there was no food). We left pretty quickly after that.",7.2
Heretic," @nicholasharris5480  I was an elder, a boy missionary. At one point someone tried to trap and sa me and my companion saying “the devil is real, and I will show you he is real”. We had so literally escape.",7.2
Heretic,"We were pretty sure he was having some kind of weird PTSD episode, as he was in the military. However it was very disturbing.",7.2
Heretic," @tylerheywood7767  Dang, glad you got out. I also had a couple of close calls. I even got punched in the face by a drunk guy once while trying to get between him and some sisters.",7.2
Heretic,I had a guy claim he was Jesus. He tried to show us nail prints in his hands. There weren't any.,7.2
Heretic,"I didn’t have anything too crazy. But there were a couple of experiences that I had that were kind of traumatic at the time:
-I tried to smile and say hi to a group of homeless men that were walking past me, and one dove to try and grab my crotch. I was able to move out of the way in time and then started to bawl to my companion. 
-one of the people we were teaching threatened to kill us. I can’t actually remember why anymore but we had offended him somehow. He sent a bunch of very disturbing texts to us. 
-we set a return appointment with a man and his female roommate but when we got there and talked at the door, he slowly opened the robe he was wearing to reveal that he was only wearing a lacy thong. We left in a hurry. 
-we went to go meet with a less active member and she lived in a decrepit little shack (only had a bed in it) and after we had been there for about 15 minutes, all of a sudden a man popped up in the bed and we realized we had been sitting on his feet. And we just had the feeling that this man was evil and we needed to get out of there. He had some real bad vibes. We felt bad though because his wife seemed so lonely and like a good person. 
-a male member sent me a bunch of love notes and said he wanted to date after I was home. I never listened to them, but when I got home I saw that he had sent hundreds of voice memos and messages on FB messenger to me. It made going to church and activities very uncomfortable. 
-and just a lot of experiences with Hungarian men being overly flirty and touchy 😝😝 and I’m sure there were plenty more traumatic events that I’ve pushed out of my memory lol. It was a good time though 😂✌️",7.2
Heretic," @Positivityispowerful I would love to swap mission stories with you. It sounds like you have some good material. I served in Latin America and often got comments about my blue eyes and stature. Lots of random creeps and occasional groping but overall not entirely traumatic. The Lord’s protection of his missionaries is real. I mean, I had a couple of close encounters but nothing nearly as jarring as when I naively traveled internationally AFTER my mission. 

Also, the preview reminded me that I’m glad the missionaries have cell phones now. 😅",7.2
Heretic," @imustremaincivil2932 thanks for checking and reporting back. Giving an accounting of your efforts is an important part of your service!

Heretic,"I got robbed at gun point, robbed another time at knife point, had a crazy naked dude stalk us along the road, had women undress in front of us (to try and get us to get them a green card), encountered many people claiming to be Jesus, some other wild stuff more so because of where I was and not because of what I was like being asked to bless a person in a hospital that was missing and entire wall to the building and had lots of holes in the ground and doors boarded up walking style with lots of chairs and junk and make shift support beams to keep the building standing. Wild stuff just happens when you talk to a bunch of people, heck, I met a guy who was a fake pimp and made his living creating fake female accounts to seduce people in the us, got them to buy him plane tickets by sending the money and he would keep it for himself and cut contact. Lots of R rated stuff too that would auto ban my comment I am afraid.",7.2
Heretic,"First house I got in,
Old Italian guy, “Giovanni, you from America! You like a de guns?”
Me, a massive gun nerd, “Yes?”

He takes us into a hidden room in the back of his apartment, covered floor to ceiling with guns. Hundreds of them. 
“Se ne vedi uno che ti piace fammi sapere!”",7.2
Heretic, @jinfin221  I can’t express how much this comment had me laughing,7.2
Heretic,"​ @jinfin221  All people are imperfect, including yourself, myself, and the ""you people"" you mentioned. To expound on that, no one is perfect enough--not even you--to be justified in celebrating the misfortunes of others who are equally as imperfect as you are. As we all are. If you believe yourself in the right to celebrate the misfortunes of others--even if a small portion of them have wronged you in some way--then I would suggest you take a step back and address your own misfortunes before you attempt to drag down the people around you in an attempt to give yourself the false sense of superiority that you seek. Improving yourself and your personal situation will bring you far more happiness, I can assure you. You can continue to drag people down, if you wish, as you have the freedom to choose for yourself, but know that if you do, in the end, you will never come out on top.",7.2

Heretic,"​​ @heldersilva3819  I think he said he was going to 'check on the  blueberry pie', but it was the candle they smelled.",7.2
Heretic,The candle was literally right next to her the whole time. She's annoying in the movie with her constant look at me micro expressions.,7.2
Heretic," @Picnicl  I know it’s not shown in the trailer but the label was facing away from them the whole time. Hugh’s character had just blown out the candle, causing the pie scent to fade, which is what prompted her to turn it around like that and make that realisation. I personally found that scene in the film to be really well done as that’s somewhat when it transitioned from a tense and uncomfortable scene, to the beginning of the horror.",7.2
Heretic,"""Sisters"" or ""elders""? I was a Mormon back in the day....",7.2
Heretic,"My wife and I had some over for dinner. We just fed them Mexican food and discussed theology / church history. We did feed them and send them home with re-fried beans, so their roommates may not have appreciated us… but that’s as bad as we got. 😂",7.2

Looking forward to watching this",7.2
Heretic,"Hugh Grant has been on a legendary roll since his performance in Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen imo,  and I am here for it all. He's just a GEM of an actor in Comedy and Dramatic roles and so A24 is a Production company we can TRUST to deliver everytime!!!!",7.2
Heretic,"Totally seeing this! This role suits Hugh perfectly now in his older days, bloody brilliant!",7.2
Heretic,"I honestly love movies that show more realistic depictions of missionaries that aren't mean spirited or overly flattering produced by the church. Having served a mission, i know that most missionaries are going through what has up to then been the most difficult experience of their entire lives and lots of them break down in tears regularly, either with home sickness or a crisis of faith. Its such a ripe environment for drama that im surprised we dont see more missionaries in non-mormon productions.",7.2
Heretic,I saw this today and it was AWESOME!!! One of the best movies I’ve seen in a while! Great storyline and pacing. Perfect casting. Just perfect!,7.2
Heretic,"Wow, this genuinely looks amazing. Hugh Grant is one of the most underrated actors of our generation.",7.2
Heretic,"As a returned missionary, this would be scary. Then again, some of us have had guns pointed point blank in our faces so maybe its based on a true story.",7.2
Heretic,"Man, I love how cool A24 is for doing these cool movies.  Hugh Grant as the villain is fantastic.",7.2
Heretic,My wife and I are really looking forward to watching this. Hugh Grant has always been one of our favourite actors,7.2
Heretic,"Finally, a little bit of orignality rather than just another cliche'd storyline or remake.",7.2
Heretic,"Hugh Grant, breaking free of the romcon typecast and exploring range has been a pleasant surprise, his role in The Gentlemen was hilarious.",7.2
Heretic,"I just finished the movie, and holy cr**! Hugh Grant was an absolute shocker! 🖤🖤🖤",7.2
Heretic,"Hugh is so versatile, he can play such a range of characters.",7.2
Heretic,Honestly finding out there is no pie would be bad enough,7.2
Heretic,Real LDS missionaries would be absolutely ecstatic to go through a fun maze like this.,7.2
Heretic,The amount of people falling asleep watching this movie is outstanding,7.2

Heretic,"I think this is the best movie trailer I’ve seen in a long time. I feel like horror movie trailers usually give too much away and it takes away from the theater experience, but this sent shivers down my spine without hardly telling me a thing, well done… me and my girlfriend can’t wait to see it",7.2
Heretic,"As someone who is a practicing Latter-day Saint, I’m curious to see where this goes. It seems like a portrayal of sister missionaries that goes deeper than making them a joke, but I wonder if it’ll lead to them losing their faith or go in a different direction.",7.2
Heretic,"Everyone is ""Ooh!""-ing and awing over Hugh Grant, but Sophie Thatcher is fucking amazing in Yellowjackets. Glad to see her and fellow cast member Ella Purnell getting more roles.",7.2

Heretic,"""Two missionaries accidentally knock upon Satan's door"" is such an amazing idea for a movie.  Can't wait.",7.2
Heretic,This trailor is definately inspired by saw X trailor. The scream and cuts   after 2:00 is very similar to saw X.😊😊,7.2
Heretic, @giantslug6969  Tf do you mean low bar? They only make bangers. You probably watch shit like Avengers and think it's peak cinema lol,7.2
Heretic, @giantslug6969  What's your idea of a high bar horror film and studio?....*waits while the troll disappears because it is unable to back up its statement*...,7.2
Heretic,"As a practicing member, it’s still cool when depictions of LDS are done somewhat accurately. There’s so many examples of people just making up stuff assuming it’s true by the logic of “eh, Mormons are weird.” Even if the depiction is critical, I’d rather they try to actually use the real details in a way that makes sense.",7.2
Heretic,​ @JustinZarian  Right?! As an Ex-Mormon myself I'm still kind of annoyed by Suzie from Stranger Things. 😂,7.2
Heretic,​@JustinZarian  you gotta admit that women would never be sent tho.  It's always young men,7.2
Heretic," @Over9000DragonFire  There are women missionaries. Sure, the majority are young men, but there's still a ton of young women who do it too.",7.2
Heretic, @JustinZarian ”The Holdovers” has a small role for a kid who’s Latter-Day Saint. Cracked me up how he talked because it brought me back.,7.2
Heretic, @Over9000DragonFire  I worked alongside sister missionaries when I served. And we did actually have to file a restraining order against a person who cyber stalked one of them (and sometimes just stalked). So it does happen and they get caught up in these situations sadly :(,7.2
Heretic," @tannerrobb8379  yeah. Unfortunately, like nearly every depiction of LDS, he’s the butt of the joke. And the joke is usually “you’re Mormon.” His is much less egregious, but it feels like Mormons in media only ever get like three or four types of stories

1. Losing their faith
2. Being ridiculed
3. Dying (happens more than you’d expected)
4. Being present

Or sometimes all of the above. Mormons almost never win in any situation when depicted in non LDS media. I don’t want people to kiss their feet and be perfect, but showing more balanced depictions wouldn’t hurt. Heck, of all the shows I studied in the past, the nicest depiction of an LDS character was in the expanse with the random member Thomas Jane meets on a flight. In general, that show has the best depictions and even it usually ends with the characters losing",7.2
Heretic," @dallenpowell2745  I’m conflicted on her depiction. She herself is fine, but it’s especially with the depiction of her family that things get weird. I know crazy Utah families exist (we’ve seen very sad examples of this in recent criminal cases), but it does feel like caricature",7.2
Heretic," @JustinZarian  Every sub-culture has their own brand of 'crazy'.  The Utah culture probably comes across as more crazy than many because it manifests in unique ways. However, having grown up in the church, being a mormon in high school, then spending my adult life outside of the church but living in Utah I can say that there is a lot of 'crazy' that never makes the news.

The guilt mechanisms the church uses to manipulate member behavior are incredibly destructive, especially when used at a family level. How ex-members portray that is likely a product of having their family and authority figures fucking with their heads and hearts during the most vulnerable years of their lives.

For more information on this topic ask me about the funerals I've been to.",7.2
Heretic," @JustinZarian  The thing that bugged me the most was that it couldn't even get the ""Some Mormons give their kids weird names"" detail right. Nichodemus? Come on, man. That kid would be named Jeremiah or Malachi, or (if they had really done their research) Helaman, Moroni, or Mahonrimoriancumr. Also, that dad would not have a mustache, either. The Wheeler's dad looked more like a stereotypical Mormon dad than that security guard guy who ditched Harrison Ford in The Fugitive when the train was coming did. And I even spotted a winged angel bust in the background at one point. 

What's sad is, this is one of the more accurate portrayals.",7.2
Heretic," @JustinZarian Yes, this antiMormonism parallels anti semitism.  How blind people are to their own bigotry.",7.2
Heretic," @JustinZarian  Exactly, Suzie is a funny character and she works well with the rest of the gang. It's when they go to her house that my disbelief has to be suspended because all of the art is very traditional catholic and some of the mannerisms are strange even for 1980s Utah. The rowdy family is pretty spot on though in my experience. Not bad just a little uninformed on the directors part in my opinion.",7.2

Heretic,It’s been so long since I felt this excited watching a movie trailer,7.2
Heretic,"BRAVO to this!  This was amazing.  A24 rarely disappoints.  They are redefining the horror genre with films that make you think.  There is a time and a place for ax wielding maniacs, and then there is intellectual horror.  These A24 films are never as literal as their trailers.  This movie keeps you guessing and was very suspenseful. The first half is a little slow because you’re expecting it to be paced differently due to horror generally moves faster…BUT they are setting up the story and every detail and every piece of dialogue matters later.  This gets in your head and in a good way.  It challenges people to THINK.   The two lead actresses were amazing and I've never cared for Hugh Grant movies, but he is deliciously evil in this.  Very well written and highly recommended.",7.2
Heretic,And what have we learned from this trailer. Never ever go inside a strangers house 😂,7.2
Heretic,"It's crazy how they never required to see the wife before actually walking into the home... although a plot where he and his wife did this together at one time, would also be great",7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant in a role like this is VERY interesting. Will see this one.,7.2
Heretic,Saw this last night and was surprised it actually kept my attention. I was expecting some slow burn but surprisingly the dialog kept my interest and I was paying attention to the choices of words was used. Not necessarily a horror but there was a lot of deception going on. Good watch if you like to get into how they movie will surprise you.,7.2

Heretic,"A24 has got the formula: a cool soundtrack, a big change in the environment after the first 1/10th of the movie, some mystery, a bit of horror, a few scary jumps, and, most importantly, one or two plot twists. Everything done on quite a low budget. Teenagers will continue to line up and say, OMG, THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE!",7.2

Heretic,You might want to put up a sign on your door!,7.2
Heretic,As a former missionary and ex-Mormon I kind of doubt this… if it is true you need to hit them with the fact that they shouldn’t be leaving their house until 8 (at the VERY earliest) so they are technically disobeying by showing up that early.,7.2
Heretic,Ok that’s because you’re letting them! I would put a sign straight up to get them off my property. Instantly. If not I’ll tell them in their face,7.2
Heretic,why you gotta go around knocking on peoples doors trying to convince them to join your religion?,7.2

Heretic,Your comment made me get up and go. Glad I did. It was a fantastic movie,7.2
Heretic,@ no way !!! I'm glad you enjoyed the film .,7.2
Heretic,He had the makings of a really good dramatic actor from the start tbh. Just watch Maurice. He's brilliant in that role and then Richard Curtis got hold of him.,7.2
Heretic, @rumblefish9  As a very young woman I was obsessed with him and that film in the 80's. First thing I ever saw him in and thought this man is going to be big.,7.2
Heretic, @rumblefish9  his best dramatic performance for me was in Extreme Measures opposite Gene Hackman.  He really impressed me in that role going toe to toe with an acting heavyweight.,7.2

Heretic,The trailer kind of lies. It makes it look like it might be set in a maze. The two girls are far too scared far too early. Would have been better if they'd found Hugh charming and interesting. The look at me micro-expressions and sarcasm of the brunette were utter overkill.,7.2
Heretic,Ok I am intrigued.. will be watching this one for sure.,7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant should have discovered this niche a LONG time ago.  It actually works for him!  Kind of like it worked for Robin Williams to play a psycho.,7.2

Heretic," @harshitgarg419  Ha! Nah, I realized I didn’t have good evidence to believe the truth claims.",7.2
Heretic, @agentcallisto  I primarily studied Mormonism through a self directed program in Amsterdam. It wasn’t explicitly Mormon studies. Claremont Graduate university in California does offer Masters in Mormon studies,7.2
Heretic,they put out banger trailers and the movies of those trailers usually end up being dog shit,7.2
Heretic,"They actually have many bad movies but yeah, they do have some great ones",7.2
Heretic,“The Air That I Breathe” has become a scary movie anthem.,7.2
Heretic,"0:23  Not quite correct.  First visit is fine without an additional person, second visit they'd either need the wife there or bring an extra lady with them.  The goal of the policy is to both protect from accusation and prevent pairing off.  Still, I'm intrigued by this.  Not often you see missionaries involved in a horror movie.",7.2
Heretic,"I saw it this afternoon and personally I liked it. A unique take on horror/ mystery with religion as the concept. Keeps you guessing throughout the movie, although I had an idea as to what the point of the movie was trying to make near the start. Great acting. My only complaint was the ending was underwhelming. 8/10",7.2
Heretic,"I just love Hugh Grant in everything he does, i think he is an amazing actor! I CANT WAIT for Heretic to be released in Greece!",7.2
Heretic,Was a great movie. Watching Hugh grant in a villian role was nice to see and well acted. By Hugh.,7.2

Heretic,"If the trailer had just ended after the candle, I would rush to the cinama",7.2
Heretic,What kind of monster makes a promise of pie and doesn’t deliver? This is a story of true evil.🤪,7.2
Heretic,I literally saw this trailer MONTHS ago and I got so caught up with life I didn’t even realize it came out until I was picking a movie to watch in the theater and honestly so happy I remembered this one. It was great and I highly recommend giving it a watch,7.2
Heretic,"As a Latter-day Saint, I think this movie will be very interesting! I just hope we're represented as people. I'm tired of Hollywood movies portraying us as anything less.",7.2
Heretic,"This is a lesson to be learned here. Don't go preaching your religion to others and trying to convince them of joining your religion because religion is made up. You believe whatever you want to believe, but don't impose it on people. It will save your life.",7.2
Heretic,It’s all fun and games until you find yourself chained up in an old bathroom with Tobin Bell and Costas Mandylor watching over you.,7.2
Heretic,Yeah the last time I saw missionaries in a horror film was in The Strangers,7.2
Heretic,Wrong. They need an adult of the same gender including the first visit.,7.2
Heretic,same I feel like the point of this will be to make you guys look evil. As an athiest i dont know why they are obsessed with hate for jesus believers. Fingers crossed Im wrong.,7.2
Heretic,"I feel like this movie idea has a very small audience. 

Im a member of the Church of Jesus Christ latter-day Saints. I served a mission. And I love horror films. The trailer actually seems to do a pretty good job of portraying what it was like to be a missionary. 

I just hope the film is not sacrilegious. If it’s not, I’m super interested. But I think many former missionaries will think this is very inappropriate. 

I guess I just don’t know how well someone who doesn’t know what it’s like to be a missionary would relate to the characters.",7.2
Heretic,This will make a Jehovas witness think twice about knocking on random doors,7.2
Heretic,"That was pretty cool idea, making the window have an evil eye. 0:15",7.2
Heretic,"um yeah... not watching that.  That scared the crap out of me, lol.  Way too creepy.  They should have asked to see the wife of the house first!",7.2
Heretic,I fell asleep in the movie. A24 has great trailers but the movie itself isn’t nearly as good. This one was a disappointment.,7.2
Heretic,AHHH I LOVE THIS SONG IT WAS IN THE SAW X TRAILER TOO,7.2
Heretic,"I love the reversal in this film. In this film, the endless maze of psychological torture is outside the church, but for me growing up, it was inside the church. Really clever",7.2
Heretic,"SPOILERS:






Heretic was a poor film. Mr. Reed's ""elaborate system"" under his house, consists of practically nothing other than a small basement. Not only that, but it takes around half of the movie for the two Mormons to go down there, so the actual story can kick in. And even when the story does kick in, it's pretty shallow. 

This is a prime example of a movie that (considering it only takes place in mostly three rooms) was clearly held back by low-budget. If the folk behind this film would have been given a larger budget, I believe they could have done far more to create a good, quality film. Instead, the directors' big ideas for Heretic had to be scaled down a thousand times because of financial purposes. A version of this film where their creative freedom wasn't forced to become drastically limited, is one I'd love to see.",7.2
Heretic,I love when you watch a movie and then watch its trailer again and catch those little details that are very important in the movie. Like the song. I didn't care about it when first watched the trailer. But then...,7.2
Heretic,This is definitely a way to keep Jehovah witnesses away 😂😂😂,7.2
Heretic,"Aww finally a film about what we would actually do to missionaries when they don't take ""no"" for an answer.",7.2
Heretic,"Perhaps the old guy is a priest of the Imperial Truth fallen to Chaos, We might need the Grey Knights for this one!",7.2
Heretic,The movie will end with a Black Templar Chaplain knocking at the door with his Crozius Arcanum.,7.2
Heretic,....soooo am i the only person that feels like this movie was a waste of my time? lmao i did not like it,7.2
Heretic,All those years wasted on boring rom coms. I’m just glad we have Hugh Grant in these awesome menacing roles now. What a man,7.2
Heretic,"The more I watch this, the more it feels like its going to be a modern interpretation of Dante's Inferno with the women being forced to confront their beliefs as they journey through a figurative (or literal) 9 levels of Hell.",7.2
Heretic,The movie is about bashing religion and not a single scrutinizing word was said against the ✡️,7.2
Heretic,"Can we stop with the repurposed popular song intended to sound ""cinematic"" in movie trailers already. Thank you.",7.2
Heretic,This movie SUCKED. The trailer is soo misleading. Thinking it was going to be something more spiritually demonic only because the movie is based of faith. And it was just totally trash. Literally,7.2
Heretic,Pie scented candles to make people think there is fresh home cooked pie in the oven is the most evil and malicious thing I have ever scene. Kidnapping and such is bad too.,7.2
Heretic,"I just watched the movie. It was good, but I don’t know why they have to make movies like that. It’s a really emotional trauma. The main conclusion here is that you never get inside to a stranger house. Especially if you’re a girl",7.2
Heretic,"Hugh Grant is 64 years old and still so charming and handsome. 
Lucky man.",7.2
Heretic,The blueberry pie candle was a nice touch for the “no pie” realization.,7.2
Heretic,Yeah I feel this too. I understand what it was going for but I don’t feel like it needed to be made,7.2
Heretic,"I liked the movie, but the ending was an horrible cop-out. Also A LOT of the plot relies on coincidence.",7.2
Heretic,"It was about questioning all religions, faith is left up to you though",7.2
Heretic,"What in the trailer led you to believe this would be a heavily spiritual and demonic movie? By that, I assume you mean supernatural. Nothing of the sort is shown in the trailer. We see a man and two girls and nothing more.",7.2
Heretic,I liked the part where the Prophet said it’s Heretic time and started Hereticing all over the place.,7.2
Heretic,"I’m 28, never heard of this actor, never had TV or Movies growing up we were poor, I fell in love with this movie the first commercial trailer I seen 

Going to go see it Nov 7th",7.2
Heretic,Well i wouldn’t realize that there is no pie just cuz there is a candle smelling blueberry pie.,7.2
Heretic,I have never even heard of Hugh Grant before and everyone is talking about how it feels different to see him taking a role like this. Guess this is my first impression on the actor,7.2
Heretic,He’s a great actor who deserves credit for taking risks and playing a darker role.  I’m totally freaked by this trailer.,7.2
Heretic,I met him once at the airport here in Dallas in 2000! He is actually a super sweet guy lol. I can’t wait to see this. I’ve never seen him do a role like this. Looks good.,7.2
Heretic,lmao the trailer music makes it seem like it set in the 70s but its in the modern day.,7.2
Heretic,"Tom Cruise needs to embrace the villain character era. 

He and Hugh Grant together would be 🫣",7.2
Heretic,A trailer that pulls you in but doesn’t give away the entire movie 🙌🏽,7.2
Heretic,"Now THIS is a horror psychological thriller I can get behind, just based off the trailer! It could be a bad film, but knowing Hugh Grant is now taking on some deep seated psychological roles in films, from some of his other roles in the early 2000's and his funny roles in 2010's, he's going to do his hardest to carry this film.

I already want to watch it because I like A24 as a media company, I like the premise of faith, and I expect there will be an amazing finale!

I'll just watch it because of the psychology involved. That's something that is severely lacking today. Used to be you could just watch Disney's Pinocchio and wonder what a ""conscience"" was, what ""real"" was. Now, it's much more complicated. The brain is so complex, and I think this movie will heavily focus on that aspect of thinking.

Also...non-United States Actors will always be seen as better actors, because they actually act their soul out. Our actors here in the USA, do put their heart into it (even their soul) but media companies will never be able to hire USA actors/actresses for less.",7.2
Heretic,"There's few things finer in life, than fresh from the oven, pie.",7.2
Heretic,This is how you do a trailer. It gives away just enough to get you wanting more but doesn't spoil anything. I'm honestly curious to see what is going on in Heretic and why.,7.2
Heretic,"Beyond the acting and all that glitz, the essence of the film is a powerful message of prevention to those thousands of young missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who take a break from their own lives and risk their lives by going to other places and countries to preach the gospel. It does matter to me because I was a missionary and I currently have a niece serving a mission in another country, and I have a daughter who, at 8 years old, always tells me that she wants to go on a mission with the characters of those actresses in this film. I appreciate this film because it puts the global spotlight on the risk that our young missionary girls could or could not run.",7.2
Heretic,"So, I don't do scary movies, too much of a pansy. But.... even just watching the trailer for this, Hugh Grant looks absolutely amazing. Doesn't he? 😮 Wow. I hope the rest of you guys enjoy it.",7.2
Heretic,Just here for all the people who have clearly never been around a scented candle. Or a context clue. You made me weep for our species. Mission accomplished?,7.2
Heretic,"The role seemed to suit Hugh Grant naturally. I’ve heard he’s a real grump in real life while still being quite charming. Like the antagonist, the movie wants to make you think philosophically about the theme but like the protagonists, you wanna smack Hugh Grant’s character for his pretentious ‘beliefs’ and disconnect with humanity",7.2
Heretic,"That was a bit foolish to assume that the blueberry pie candle meant that there was NO blueberry pie. Like make it be something more reasonable than that. He could have still came out with real ""blueberry pie"" ....",7.2
Heretic,what’s that old saying don’t talk to strangers don’t go into strangers' houses that’s the way the ball bounces,7.2
Heretic,Best movie ive seen this month. Anyone who wnats to see this please go and do that. You wont be disappointed. I dont like hugh grant but he was fabulous in this 👏,7.2
Heretic,I'm dying to know if Hugh Grant decides to get baptized in the end.,7.2
Heretic,Props to whoever made this for not using the term mormon,7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant is such a brilliant actor and presence. Wonderful that he is branching out from doing Rom-coms. Bravo!,7.2
Heretic,"How could they spoil the scariest part of the movie?
There’s no pie!! 😢",7.2
Heretic,That scene in which the young ladies had to carry the bikes up the stairs was really neat.,7.2
Heretic,"I bet after this movie out for a while, the ""How to Beat"" Youtube channel is gonna make a video on this film called ""How to Beat the Maze in Heretic"".",7.2
Heretic,Hugh grant AND Sophie thatcher. Ima have to watch this one. Grants been killing it lately,7.2
Heretic,Must be a safe feeling to know you’re in the presence of the best damn doctor this hospital has ever known,7.2
Heretic,No fucking way i'm feeling some type of way with these dude 💀💀💀,7.2
Heretic,Loved this perspective! How about starting a Q&A series on practical Stoicism?,7.2
Heretic,"As a Latter Day Saint, I’ve always prayed for the protection of the young women preaching the gospel to random strangers.  It’s hard enough for men.",7.2
Heretic,"I'm a former lds missionary. Back in the day I served 2011 to 2013 female missionaries had to wear darker colors but now they can wear bright colors and even pants. They were allowed to wear brighter colors at the very end of my mission in early 2013. This trailer sort of conveys how the more socially awkward mssionaries would come across. Id usually tell them ""we're representatives of Jesus Christ"" and try to start any conversation I could in a casual manner. I dare say I hated the initial street contacting as it was painful for me as a young man to get that kind of rejection.",7.2
Heretic,Saw it a couple days ago... intriguing plot and worth the watch. I give it a solid 8.5/10,7.2
Heretic,"Just saw the movie. At first I was a bit disappointed at what it turned out to be, but the more I think about it the more I notice there are stuff to think about. Probably will watch it again later, actually",7.2
Heretic,"I don't know if anyone else noticed, but this is the second trailer that I hear the song ""The air that I breathe"" by The Hollies . The first trailer is Saw X . It is just a coincidence?",7.2
Heretic,I didn't understand why she felt scared when she noticed that what is written on the candle is blue berry pie ? Please can someone explain to me ?,7.2
Heretic,"Great film! Though throu 80% of the film
however a good film that is more suspense more than horror (I don't like horror films).
Highly recommended! Great performance from everyone",7.2
Heretic,Beyond excited to see this movie and bravo for putting Hugh Grant in such a compelling role.,7.2
Heretic,"i didn't saw this film yet ,i don't know if it is great or just ok,but i have to say i am very glad that Hugh Grant plays another type of character",7.2
Heretic,It took me way too long to realize the blueberry pie candle was to lure them is lol😂😂😂,7.2
Heretic,"I would be surprised if Hollywood, in any capacity, would show young Christians in a good light. As heroes of their story, regardless of the genre.",7.2
Heretic,When he invites you over for Netflix and chill but he ain’t got no TV… the movie,7.2
Heretic,This has all the makings of a modern masterpiece. Looks like it will be.,7.2
Heretic,"by they way, wait until they find out his name is actually Huge Grant.   that'll put the fear in them.",7.2
Heretic,"Well, you definitely gotta see this movie. And look for all the clues. There are clues everywhere in this movie. The music that has played the way he articulates everything the words that he says everything. There are so many clues in this movie. I actually have thought it was a really good movie. I enjoyed it very much, it's just the ending needed to be reworked.  Well, isn't that there?It was a good movie, um.We all enjoyed it caught it thirteen out of thirteen scholars straight across the boarddefinitely a must see need to see again",7.2
Heretic,"If you're a Jigsaw-esque serial killer, why wouldn't you put your blood covered candle on a shelf instead of the living room table?",7.2
Heretic,"Wow, could be the first decent horror movie in recent history",7.2
Heretic,"Would you classify it as a religious horror film or is it more of a thriller? Like compare it maybe to immaculate or the nun haha, that’s where my mind goes and I didn’t like those films",7.2
Heretic, @joliemadigan4244  I haven't see either of those movies but I'd say it's more of a thriller that's about religions with horror elements.,7.2
Heretic,"@HamzaKadd-p9z   thank you , but please be patient with me a little bit because I still didn't get it , how when she reads blue berry on the candle, she concluded that he was lying?  Maybe his wife is making blue berry pie in the kitchen and the candle is also blue berry smell . ( sorry my English is not good I apologize for Grammer mistakes) . I know in the movie he doesn't have a wife , but I just wanted to know how she concluded he is lying by only looking to the blue berry candle? Why she get scared when she looking to the candle",7.2
Heretic,​ @HamzaKadd-p9z That's not a spoiler — it's literally in the trailer 🤣,7.2
Heretic,What do u mean by ex? Now ur unreligious? Just curious,7.2
Heretic,"You know, i always do enjoy escape room type of movies. I think im gonna enjoy this one.",7.2
Heretic,"If Hugh Grant would invite me into his home, I'd gladly apply to live there permanently, even if he was a murderer or a monster.",7.2
Heretic,What's the song used at the very start of this trailer?,7.2
Heretic,I will never go into a Bath and Body Works store again!!😱😱😱,7.2
Heretic,"Saw this at Fantastic Fest, it's good based off what is shown in this trailer. If you have any knowledge of actual religion, I believe this will cause you to question some of the logic in your religious belief. This movie is meant for those not too strong in their knowledge, and for that it is amazing in its points. But if you are knowledgeable and able to answer this movies questions, it's gonna fall flat. Hugh Grant is amazing no matter what your beliefs are though.",7.2
Heretic,"I read that both actresses were LDS members growing up. Sophie Thatcher confirmed this, but Chloe East hasn't.",7.2
Heretic,Holding a watering can on a rainy day is a red flag.,7.2
Heretic,"Wish hugh grant had never done rom com, he's an awesome actor and it feels wasted that he's been in less roles like this",7.2
Heretic,"I've always liked Hugh Grant. This looks a good horror, good trailer ⭐🌙",7.2
Heretic,I doubt the rest of the movie will be as consistent but this was an objectively accurate portrayal of LDS missionaries,7.2
Heretic,"This was my life as a Mormon missionary, I have always felt afraid of going to someone’s  house  like that",7.2
Heretic,"Never thought I'd actually want to watch a movie staring Hugh Grant! I'm not a fan of rom coms, but I'll watch this!",7.2
Heretic,Knocking ppl doors for a living is the most dangerous job you can do....... Trust me.... was held for hours by someone who tested my morals and tolerance to the limits..... Working for the salvation army...,7.2
Heretic,These movies are just showcasing what the elite do for fun,7.2
Heretic,Serves you right for trying to spread the word to people that don't care.,7.2
Heretic,"First the cake is a lie
Now there is no pie

Really making me distrust my desert choices.",7.2
Heretic,"Many year ago I lived in a top floor flat , constant intercom problems. I could hear it but couldn’t talk through it and it’s a long way down to the ground floor.
There I am trying to do some diy, just hit my thumb with hammer, not in the best of moods. Intercom goes won’t stop ringing. So I’m off down the stairs, muttering to myself , hammer in hand.
Open the door, two ladies “ hello we’re from the Mormon society” . Tall one looks at me , looks at the hammer, I look at the hammer .
“ not today ladies “ and closed the door.",7.2
Heretic,I bet he’ll ask them if they believe life after death and one of them will take their chances and die and the other won’t and will be released.,7.2
Heretic,Honestly if I saw those candles I would have just thought the dude was really into blueberry pie.,7.2
Heretic,"This movie was really well done! Watched it a couple days ago! Also a member of the same church as the missionaries. I think they did us fair, only one error, and one sister is a bit stereotypical.",7.2
Heretic,I can’t wait for this movie it’s feels like waiting forever I like Sophie Thatcher,7.2
Heretic,Blue berries are said to be a gift from the Great spirit in Native American legend.,7.2
Heretic,"I‘m not gonna lie…the way that camera panned to the candle sent a chill of pure dread down my spine. That said: you have a lamp heavy enough to hit him over the head with. The literal candle is burning…use his trap to set the place on fire. There’s 2 of you and one of him…jump him. Why did they go in, in the first place, without insisting to see the wife first? (She might have been real and a lunatic, but still). I don’t watch horror because the complete stupidity and the lack of fighting of the victims always makes me irrationally angry…",7.2
Heretic,"When i was 12 i watched Bridget Jones and fell in love with Hugh Grant, then watched Love Actually, Love and Lyrics,  Nothing Hill and gosh, i was about to cry when i saw him like an oompa loompa (or however it writes) but watching him like a serial killer gosh thank you A24 for too much 😢 btw Maxxxine was spectacular",7.2
Heretic,"My fellow LDS members who are watching this , are you excited?! I know I am🦅",7.2
Heretic,"If Hugh Grant is in it, it’s going to be a worthwhile experience. He rarely ever steers audiences into a film not worth watching.",7.2
Heretic,I want to see Hugh Grant in more roles like this,7.2
Heretic,That's just like the plot of Maze Runner. They put you in a Maze with the intention of doing some good but not giving a shit about what you think of it all 😂,7.2
Heretic,"Definitely intrigued by this one! If someone has seen it—is it particularly gory? I can watch gory films and sometimes enjoy them, but I need to be in the right headspace lol",7.2
Heretic,"@ Thank you! I wish I didn’t need warnings like this, but I don’t want to get nauseous in the theater😅 It looks like a great film which is why I knew I had to ask! I’ll have to go see it when I’m in the headspace.",7.2
Heretic,"Love the movie but OBSESSED with the song!!!!
THE AIR THAT I BREATH THE HOLLIES 🥹😍
Who else ?",7.2
Heretic,Just saw Hugh Grant at Eaton centre when he was in Toronto for TIFF. Literally was so close to him but didn’t ask for selfie or bothered him🥹.,7.2
Heretic,the song is actually the saw x trailer song and i think that's beautiful,7.2
Heretic,"As someone who is ex-lds and served a mission I'm interested in seeing this. It looks like what they're saying is accurate to what missionaries would typically say. To anyone who is reading this, I do believe the church is true for the most part and high suggest inquiring about it unless you're LGBTQ. While they try to be kind to those outside of traditional families, they don't fully have a place for you within the church or after this life. They claim their stance is based on doctrine, but to me and many others it's a man made policy. There are a few man made policies, but other than those, the belief, values,  and community is wonderful.",7.2
Heretic,Whoaaaa! I dont like horror movies but i love this concept right here! The pan down to the candle label showing there wasnt a pie was AMAZING!!!!!!!,7.2
Heretic,Has anyone watched this movie? Is it worth watching in theatres?,7.2
Heretic,"if this film makes them stop knocking on my door, then hallelujah.",7.2
Heretic,2 girls going inside an old man's house while it's raining gives me uncomfortable flashback with a centipede.,7.2
Heretic,Can’t wait to see it tonight. As a kid I was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness so this strikes a whole different note of terror for me. Ehehehe,7.2
Heretic,I have to say in the last 6 years Hollywood keeps surprising me so with picking unusual actors to portray a more sinister role. The first time I was surprised by this was Efron as Bundy. Most recently was Firth from playing the wife killer in the Stairs show.,7.2

Heretic,Ever since Dungeons and Dragons I have a new found respect for Hugh Grant.,7.2
Heretic,I'd runaway in horror if I was forced to listen to that 80's Hollies too,7.2
Heretic,Maybe that way people ringing on ones door to teach about the Bible will learn it is just not a good idea 😂,7.2
Heretic,At long last a film that will hopefully give the door knockers second thoughts or it might just make them travel in groups of street walking door knockers BLESSED BE :face-purple-crying::hand-purple-blue-peace::hand-purple-blue-peace::hand-purple-blue-peace::hand-purple-blue-peace:,7.2
Heretic,the old “would you like some pie” trick got they ahhs,7.2
Heretic,"I couldn’t even watch this trailer, let alone the movie! Frightening.  But love Hugh Grant! Looks like he’s brilliant in this!",7.2
Heretic,oompa loompa became a menace if you dont pay your coco debt,7.2
Heretic,Just saw this at Fantastic Fest. Awesome movie; Hugh Grant is amazing.,7.2
Heretic,"😶...Blueberry candle 
I wonder where he told them his wife was🤔

this is why people plant cameras in folks home, but once you get them out or cover them, they will be afraid that you will set things up like this in your home so they will try to get you out of your home..

This looks good, and May the good Lord protect those who are out here inviting people to church💙💚",7.2
Heretic,"Finally, a film that speaks to the horrors of religion. All religions.",7.2
Heretic,"I really wanna see this movie but I’m terrified of jump scares. For anyone who’s seen it, are there any? And if there are any, are there just a few or are there a number that will make me piss my pants?",7.2
Heretic,They were talking about this movie on Good Morning America last week,7.2
Heretic,I'm in for everything Hugh Grant does ♥ Can't wait to see it,7.2
Heretic,Rubbish. Dont get fooled by this trailer i fel asleep in cinema,7.2
Heretic,"You’re obviously going to get wildly different opinions from strangers on the internet. That being said, I thought it was great.",7.2
Heretic,It’s not a jump scare movie. I loathe jump scare movies. I saw this and did not jump once.,7.2
Heretic,"Sophie Thatcher is phenomenal in Yellowjackets, can't wait to see her in this.",7.2
Heretic,They sadly made this movie look a lot better than what it was. Great premise but they barely scratched the surface of what it could've been.,7.2
Heretic,"Honestly, they made the trailer too good. Just saw the move today and what the trailer portrays vs what the movie actually is, is SO different. 
He just yaps at them for like an hour. I thought this was going to be a crazy maze with some demons/eldrich terrors.l that make them question their faith. It was not. :(",7.2
Heretic,"Saw it before seeing the trailer over the weekend. Oh wow is it good. For those in North America, this is something to look forward to after the election fatigue.",7.2
Heretic,I can't get over how the first line in the trailer is lord and savior jesus christ it's just so comical how she tried saying it to a lady passing by.,7.2
Heretic,"Lowkey hope this is the only trailer that gets released!. They always display best scenes in the trailer, but hope this is the only one 😅",7.2
Heretic,Does anyone know if this is a different version of “Creep” played in the background?,7.2
Heretic,The geiger counter sound effect at 0:53 implies the candle is radioactive,7.2
Heretic,It's a little insensitive to Mormons though. There are already too many thriller stories against Catholics too. Can't we just have more normal dateline style films?,7.2
Heretic,I dont think Hugh is the bad guy here. He has aromatic candles!,7.2
Heretic,Does anyone else care if this has actually something true to say about belief? Looking forward to it either way 🎉,7.2
Heretic,what's the song name that plays at the last few seconds of the video?,7.2
Heretic,"If I had a dollar for every time I heard The Hollies in a horror movie trailer, id have $2. Which isn't a lot, but its weird that it happened twice.",7.2
Heretic,Going to see this tonight 11/8!  It’s going to be great!,7.2
Heretic,I saw another clip in which he's explaining the 3 major religions and brings the Holly's into the equation.   I look forward to seeing this.,7.2
Heretic,What’s the name of the song that plays in the beginning?,7.2
Heretic,Hugh grant is exceptional in these roles his voice and nice guy/not lean perfectly towards it ❤.,7.2
Heretic,"Women,tell him to have the wife come and invite you in...some people are too innocent.",7.2
Heretic,Is this like a morbid version of Honey I shrunk the kids?! I just realized that from the final frames of the trailer. I like where they're going with this.,7.2
Heretic,Because he told them the blueberry cake was in the oven and then she realized the smell was coming from the candle.,7.2
Heretic,The stake president should have warned them about trying to proselytize a Unitarian Universalist. What a pity…,7.2
Heretic,"Step aside, Catholics—it's time for the Mormons to take center stage in the world of cinematic horror!",7.2
Heretic,"Inside Hugh Grant's home, those two girls are not great actually, suddenly.",7.2
Heretic,"The last of the Highwaymen, and he's always been a class act. 🥃 here is to you Willie Nelson!",7.2
Heretic,"I’ve heard many mixed things on this trailer so here is my opinion as a recently returned missionary! 

I just got back from my mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I actually am excited for this movie. (Even though I hate horror) from the trailer I like how they have represented the Sister Missionaries, and it genuinely feels pretty respectful. 

They have outfits, hair, even the proselyting bags down. You can tell they put a ton of attention to detail to the creation of this movie. (Major props!!!!)

And from the trailer the missionaries seem to be made out as attentive and smart, such as not entering his home unless an adult female was present (unfortunately people lie) noticing the candle, and trying to get out of the situation. 

-I had an experience on my mission where we were teaching a man who said his wife was inside, luckily she was, she was an older woman that only spoke Lebanese and was in very poor health, so she had a hard time moving and did not meet us at the door. We had no reason to believe he was lying, and he wasn’t, I can’t even IMAGINE what these Sisters would have been thinking, knowing they unknowingly put themselves in such a terrible situation. 

But as a recently returned missionary I don’t know if I will be able to watch this movie as soon as it comes out. It is way too real. Missionaries see a lot of terrible things, and unfortunately many are put in danger, but luckily the church has implemented so many great trainings, resources, and procedures to do everything they can to insure the safety of their Missionaries and other members. 

My love goes out to all the families that lost loved ones as they were out serving the Lord. May they rest in peace 🤍

These Sisters Missionaries are young girls, average aged 19-28,  often living in foreign places, speaking a different language, companions with someone they just met, meeting with dozens of strangers a week, hoping that situations like this will only happen in movies. 

While it is very interesting to see this representation it might take me a while to actually WATCH it, I currently have way too many loved ones and friends out on missions 😂",7.2
Heretic,"All of these comments seem like they were created by friends and fam of the production. Though the movie trailer is very good and intriguing, I am totally distracted by the inauthenticity of the comments.",7.2
Heretic,"I watched this movie.

I have a girlfriend that is in the process of leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses, and was considering seeing this, based on the trailer.

I cautioned her against it, since I told her about some parts that I thought would be rather distressing for her, given her journey out of JW.

After my brief elaboration, she agreed with my assessment that she would find some parts triggering if she saw them.",7.2
Heretic,"The Hollies! what a tune, just fit excellent for this movie!",7.2
Heretic,I don’t watch a lot of movies. So it makes sense that I didn’t recognize Hugh Grant that quickly. Been a while. Why not release this in October before Halloween?,7.2
Heretic,I wonder when these girls are gonna stay in the house for,7.2
Heretic,"When he is humming, is it the song ""creep"" by Radiohead? Can't wait for the movie, Hugh Grant is a most excellent villain.",7.2
Heretic,I haven't seen it but the critics all seem to like it.,7.2
Heretic,A horror movie with two LDS sister missionaries.  That is a first.,7.2
Heretic,This is gonna be insanely good. Interesting that it's about two mormon missionaries too.,7.2
Heretic,I thought it was Robert Shiller for a moment. And thought this was a documentary/drama about a person always pessimistic about the future.,7.2
Heretic,Wait is this film actually going to give a accurate depiction of heresy,7.2
Heretic,Ive been getting alot of latter day saints ads for this video,7.2
Heretic,Is this a different version of the song “creep” in the background?,7.2
Heretic,It's raining but they are not getting soaked? Come on dawg! Come on mehn!,7.2
Heretic,Looks good.  Weird seeing Hugh Grant playing more villain roles as he gets older.   He's picking up Alan Ford's torch.,7.2
Heretic,so.... there is a pie .... right? i am a bit confused if there is one.,7.2
Heretic,"What I love about the trailer is it's not even clear if Hugh Grant's character is actually ""evil"" in any way. He's potentially offering them a rite of passage to salvation and revelation. He's getting them to confront what ""real faith"" is, and offering them a way to ""temper it in the fire"". I'm all in.",7.2
Heretic,Not a bad movie but the trailer implying that the movir would be them exploring some kind of maze/labyrinth and that not being the movie AT ALL pissed me off and brought the movie down for me. Now that I know what it's doing i may like it more on a rewatch but as is I'm disappointed,7.2
Heretic,"Are you telling a joke based on the movie? If not, he makes a point that this song is where Creep comes from. :) Hope that helps, without spoiling it.",7.2
Heretic,Yea I was expecting some sort of escape room type stuff but nah I was far off but still it wasn't a bad movie,7.2
Heretic,"Finally, somebody wrote a horror script where religious missionaries got trapped. It's right there for the taking.",7.2
Heretic,Finally a movie for every person who has hated the early morning doorbell rings on the weekend from missionaries. This movie looks awesome!,7.2
Heretic,This is an unusual and unique film. Most people know little of the mormon culture.,7.2
Heretic,"from the handle and the color of the door they took the disbelief door?
I wonder what was their thought process for it.",7.2
Heretic,"OMGGGGGGGGGGGG so unique, so gripping, so thrilling, I cant wait 🤩",7.2
Heretic,The plot is unique. But be warned it gets gory in some scenes.,7.2
Heretic,"@ thanks, haven’t been to the cinema in awhile might have to go for this one.",7.2
Heretic,Dont bother unless you want to fall asleep not worth it,7.2
Heretic,"Don’t bother, I went today to see it. The trailer is so misleading",7.2
Heretic,@ more philosophical than horror? To me the trailer doesn’t lead too much.,7.2
Heretic," @dreamsneezer8668 This movie was great. If you want PG13 jump scare fodder or Terrifier gore trash, this will not satisfy you. If you want an atmospheric and suspenseful thriller with some horror elements, watch it.",7.2
Heretic,"Got one today, apparently I’m in their system and they know my last name. That’s probably the biggest horror of them all.",7.2
Heretic,So happy we are finally getting some great horror movies in cinemas again 🎉,7.2
Heretic,Oh dear. Oh dear. Didn't work for me. Something just not right about the feel of this movie. Was it made for TV? 😢,7.2
Heretic,WAIT OMG THE WOMAN FROM YELLOW JACKETS SHES CASTED HERE AHHHH!,7.2
Heretic,"can't wait to watch it and read the wikipedia about it afterwards
it's gonna be so good",7.2
Heretic,Also there was a photo-frame of him as a single person no mrs there...,7.2
Heretic,Cannot wait to watch this!!! Hugh grant as a villain is genius!,7.2
Heretic,"What an amazing movie,
the charm of Hugh Grant in a horror movie such as this what a brilliant idea.
Movie was captivating from start to finish.
Brilliant cinematography. 
Movie made you question your own beliefs.",7.2
Heretic,Omg!! we should have a guy like this in every town to scare off the Missionaries knocking on our doors,7.2
Heretic,Just watching the trailer I found the part where he claims his wife’s home but don’t get her to come to the door to prove she’s home before they come in kinda odd but the movie looks like it’s goona be crazy,7.2
Heretic,I tought sophie thatcher was anya taylor joy they really lookalike. Damn,7.2
Heretic,"Anyone else think with the glasses on, he vaguely resembles ""The Dead Zone""-era Christopher Walken?",7.2
Heretic,Would be a lot shorter movie if they would’ve just rushed him @1:23 lol,7.2
Heretic,"Is Grant turning into Michael Cane as he ages? If so, I love it!",7.2
Heretic,"It is coming in NOV, yeah that makes sense after all who wants to watch scary movies during the Halloween season?",7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant was really good in it. At least a good movie to watch.,7.2
Heretic,I used to know his personally. We went to the same school from age 9 to 18.,7.2
Heretic,does this movie has anything to do with the game that was released in 1994,7.2
Heretic,"🎶oompa loompa doopedy doo, these girls are mormans, and their definitely screwed🎶",7.2
Heretic,I am not a fan of a24 movies and I'm not expecting much but this looks somewhat interesting so ill check it out,7.2
Heretic,"Idky no one had thought of writing a horror movie where the Jehovah Witnesses are running and hiding for their lives than them, making us want to run to turn off the lights, be quiet while hiding behind the door while we peek through the blinds till they leave lmfao😂😂😂😂",7.2
Heretic,"In an interview, Grant says it's not anti-Mormon, YET the very first scene MOCKS LDS.  I'm not Mormon nor will I ever be, but I don't see mocking religons as entertainment.",7.2
Heretic,"Jigsaw, but with Jehovah witnesses ? Now you got my interest.",7.2
Heretic,Will it still work on me if I want the door-knockers to die?,7.2
Heretic,Looks like someone turned the escape room game into a movie. Hmm.,7.2
Heretic,"I don’ like horror, but at least I like Hugh Grant more now. Never liked to see him in his romcom movies.",7.2
Heretic,"The antagonist mocks it but the movie itself challenges both sides. It’s basically like the South Park episode, “I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people.” I don’t know if you need to pay $15 to understand that though",7.2
Heretic,"When Hollywood finally realised Hugh Grant was a bad guy (by his own admissio), they finally started getting the best out of him.",7.2
Heretic,Ever since the gentleman hugh grant has found his callings a bad guy in movies...same as love joy in John wick,7.2
Heretic,Heretic and Long legs both have interesting and captivating trailers but both the films itself was rather disappointing,7.2
Heretic,Female Mormon missionaries? Sophie Thatcher was raised Mormon. I only know this because I was too. No longer in that cult. I hope Hollywood doesn’t paint Mormons as being angels because they’re not. But I really love Sophie Thatcher in Yellowjackets. 👍,7.2
Heretic,Gotta start carrying the Glock around if you’re stepping in random houses lol end that movie quick 😂,7.2
Heretic,"Horror movies really don't interest me. I just don't enjoy them. especially anything with gratuitous violence or gore. I know others love them and it's a safe way to be scared in this life and they can be real thought provoking things too. So I just let people enjoy them, am glad they are there for others to enjoy and I just ignore them.
However,..
I am a Hugh Grant fan. I have thought for years he was criminally underrated by critics and typecast and pigeonholed by the industry. In recent years, freed from being a romantic lead cause Hollywood is horribly ageist, he's had a much more fun variety of roles. Usually comedic but definitely different. Paddington 2 anyone?
So I reckon I will break my long standing aversion to horror/chiller films of unpleasantness just to watch him be the bad guy in this. Great piece of casting from the looks of it, and I hope he's able to shine, and the film is good.",7.2
Heretic,when someone wore that glasses i knew something sh*t is going to happen.,7.2
Heretic,"“We understand the fascination some in the media have with the Church, but regret that portrayals often rely on sensationalism and inaccuracies that do not fairly and fully reflect the lives of our Church members or the sacred beliefs that they hold dear,” (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, said in a statement.)",7.2
Heretic,"Me being in the church that these girls are in, it can happen that they are in the home of a crazy person and it is actually one of my fears for going on a mission.",7.2
Heretic,"When you get old and lose your sex appeal, you become a villain.",7.2
Heretic,"Why wasn't the candle lit?  I assume he fooled the girls with the pie story because of the scent of the candle, since one of the girls hones in on it being a blueberry scented candle. But it's not lit!!!  I'ma still go see it!  Okay, I rewatched it and it was lit when they came in, but mysteriously goes out.  Is that part of the suspense?  I'ma still go see it, lol!",7.2
Heretic, @philbrooks5979  okay! I was just saying the official statement from the church in case anyone was curious.,7.2
Heretic," @emmanelson5888  
Well then don't complain about inaccuracies and misrepresentations when the LDS does this exact thing with actual Christianity.",7.2
Heretic, @philbrooks5979  hi! I think you’re confused. I was just quoting what they said about it. But thanks for your concern!!! 😁,7.2
Heretic,"I watched this film earlier today + this proves that A24 are on their own league when it comes to films.

Such original plots.

Though-provoking, too.

Superb film! Now I wait for ‘Queer’ + ‘Babygirl’.",7.2
Heretic,I’m getting last house on the left vibes (the original I mean) not the remake even though I love both,7.2
Heretic,Such a well  made trailer - creepy enough but difficult to pin down the sub genre of horror!,7.2
Heretic,Do these girls not have cellphones? They cant lock themselves in the bathroom and call 911? Or secretly text someone and have that person call 911 while they keep Hugh Grant talking?,7.2
Heretic,This looks really interesting and definitely something that I would like to watch. It’s so funny to me when a comedy actor does a horror movie because you’re so used to seeing him be the funny guy that it comes across way more creepy when he’s playing the villain does anybody know what I mean? But I’m definitely gonna watch this one.,7.2
Heretic,"Just to make the movie the movie a bit more fun, I’m thinking about getting a few of my friends and place bets on which girl would make it out first. And anytime someone says “Jesus” or “Christ” they have to take a drink.",7.2
Heretic,Whoever made the movie must have gotten real sick of Mormons knocking on their door at 7am on a Sat morning...,7.2
Heretic,"Perhaps a tenet of their religion is no cell phones? Or maybe he has no signal at his house, as it seems to be in the woods",7.2
Heretic,Just Hollywood confusing you bout Gods existence.. and PRAYER DOES WORK!,7.2
Heretic,The main characters look more like goth yupsters  than Mormon missionaries just sayin 🤔,7.2
Heretic,"Jaktoze někdo našel plány mojí tajný místnosti?! 😂

Přesně takovýhle chodby mám na bílý hoře 😂😂😂😅🎉😂

Já za to nemůžu, ze jste to nenašli 😂😅",7.2
Heretic,"""Refugee"" shenanigans in Europe... Natives finding solidarity, embracing Christian heritages... I find the timing, casting, and theme of this movie to be rather curious.",7.2
Heretic,"Ok, I’ll admit, the trailer is very well crafted and the storyline seems very well written. And Hugh Grant seems tailor made for almost any role he tackles, including this one. That being said, as a life-long active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a returned missionary, I have some issues with the protagonists being sister missionaries from the LDS faith. Almost everyone knows our missionaries go door to door as they try to share faith in Jesus Christ, but there are guidelines in place to prevent things exactly like this story from happening in real life…that’s my brief soapbox.",7.2
Heretic,What a damning blow to The Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints Missionary program. Way to go.,7.2
Heretic,This is a well done movie I saw it 3 times n the theaters,7.2

Heretic,Speak No Evil 2024 Brought me here this does look interesting.,7.2
Heretic,Damn...and here i was expecting Corvus and the 3 Serpent Riders,7.2
Heretic,what if this movie was just 2 girls that REALLLY wanted pie and they realized there was no pie so they tortured the dude until he made them a pie but all they had to do was just like say please and he felt bad for lying so he made them some pie and then they ate it and left and the credits rolled.,7.2
Heretic,"Dark, upsetting. If it was your daughter how would you feel? It could be any youth being sadistically kidnapped and tortured. Don't we have enough in real life?",7.2
Heretic,I wish to god all Mormons  and  JW's watch this movie and never door knock again,7.2
Heretic,"As a Mormon who doesn’t believe anymore, this looks hilarious. Super weird plot though. At first I thought it was going to be a movie about revealing abuse in the church or something like that. I’m glad it didnt go that way in the trailer because that would be terrible and too dark for me to want to watch a movie of.",7.2
Heretic,Awesome!  In how many US states will the Christian Taliban try to ban this one?  Opening in Salt Lake City!?,7.2
Heretic,finally a film that captures the unspeakable horror of Hugh Grant,7.2
Heretic,LoL Hugh Grant as a killer 😂😂😂 Too hilarious!! I have to see this.,7.2

Heretic,"A horror movie with Latter Day Saints? Ok then, that’s a new one",7.2
Heretic,God I hope this scares these types of folks from going door to door ever again,7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant was fine af in this movie and I'm not going to pretent like he wasn't.,7.2
Heretic,is there a scene with arms mutilation/self harm please ? I have ptsd with this and cannot watch mutilation without having a panic attack :(,7.2
Heretic,"is this trying to scare people away from proselytizing....out of all the times this has happened IRL, i dont think any of them were spreading the word",7.2
Heretic,Is he humming...creep? Is that the next one to get the scary slowed down version? 😅,7.2
Heretic,I know this film is good!!! It’s amazing when God is in the mix how people gain a great level of trust. All Jehovah’s Witnesses need to watch this film. 😂,7.2
Heretic,"So basically, evangelism is good but don’t ever go into a strangers house.",7.2
Heretic,Horrible trailer shows absolutely nothing now i am forced to go watch the entire bloody film!,7.2
Heretic,Did anyone else see that creepy ass figure behind the blonde girl at 1:57 👀 turn up your brightness on your phone.,7.2
Heretic,"Finally a movie, that can scare the living sh#% out of door to door missionaries.",7.2
Heretic,"Why are so many people confused about this 😂 ? 
He says he’s making one then she finds a blueberry pie scented candle.
There is no pie.",7.2
Heretic,"Looks interesting.  My only real gripe would be, he built a belief-based puzzle box in his home to ""study"" people in the hopes that one day a couple of jehovah's witnesses would wind up on his front porch?  Seems like a bit of a stretch in terms of logic.",7.2
Heretic,"Was that Hugh Grant?Was that Hugh Grant?Holy s*** haven't seen me a long time.She spoke english, not British.What happened",7.2
Heretic,"Are the Mormons going to be hanging out at theatres showing this like they do with ""The Book of Mormon""? Because that'd be.....something.",7.2
Heretic,"This trailer came on unexpectedly at deadpool and wolverine, that was fuckin weird",7.2
Heretic,I AM LDS AND THE MORMON CHURCH IS VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS MOVIE. PEOPLE IN OUR CHURCH DOESNT WATCH THIS TYPE OF MOVIE AND MANY ARE UPSET OUR RELIGION IS INCLUDED IN IT,7.2
Heretic,Grew up as a jehovah witness i know this is going to hit,7.2
Heretic,"This movie trailer metaphorically represent ones experience
Just happens the man is actually English 😂
He have similar personality of ones exes
At face valve he is all sunshine and rainbows but his personality is opposite from persona 😂
Girls knocking on his door 
Represent me knocking on the door of interracial relationship 😂
If only I knew but one learnt a lesson through experience 
Girls locked in
Represent binding spells 😂
The challenges the girls experienced in the man's house
Represent the abuse, bullying and racism one experienced
Only for these exes to say the want to return 🤨
Don't make sense
Who in their right mind will accept abuse on all level and all aspects? 
Trying to make sense from nonsense 🤨
Wonder if these girls will return if they’re able to make it out alive? 🤨",7.2
Heretic,Cat and mouse you say....... Looks like a interesting movie. 🤔🧐 It was a good movie but the end . I think it should of been different .The butterfly effect you say.......,7.2
Heretic,It would’ve been interesting if he were a religious study professor and his students or RAs got trapped. The young women being trapped and tortured is such a played out plot.,7.2
Heretic,Unless there’s a twist ending that I’m pretty sure will happen in the end,7.2
Heretic,"I know Mormons who saw it and liked it. If you actually watch the movie you will probably be okay with it once you get to the end because it completely validates faith and belief. 🤷‍♀️ You have to watch it for yourself and form an opinion based on the actual content, not be outraged when you haven’t even watched the movie because of what you think might be in it. That is ignorant.",7.2
Heretic,"I just saw the movie. Both my boyfriend and I were disappointed.  It’s nice to see Hugh Grant in a different genre, but honestly it was not very exciting. He fell asleep He fell at least 4 or 5 times.  I had to keep poking him to wake him up.  It’s a sleeper horror flic.",7.2
Heretic,"For a second,I thought it was going to end up being a creampie.",7.2

Heretic,I want to see this but I'm scared I'll get too scared lol,7.2
Heretic,"I'll admit when I saw the trailer for the RomCom A24 I thought we weren't going to get as many of these awesome horrors. 

I was wrong. Unconditionally.",7.2
Heretic,"I heard on some yt channel this was a ripoff of hereditary, but glad it wasnt",7.2
Heretic,We cant come inside if a woman isnt present. Guess she asked wrong question.,7.2
Heretic,Does as any what this movie is on or still at movies,7.2
Heretic,"The man claimed he was baking a pie 🥧, but what the girl actually smelled was a blueberry pie-scented CANDLE! O.O",7.2
Heretic,Perfect 1st and 2nd act only for the 3rd act to be lame and disappointing! 7 out of 10! Worth watching for the most part I guess.,7.2
Heretic,"This movie was painful. As in, I couldn't even enjoy it for being bad, it was that bad.",7.2
Heretic,"I wonder did someone care to make a thriller about Sinead O'Connor, pope and child abuse. Because this... some popcorn show for maga. Not what I expected from A24",7.2
Heretic,please stop putting janky ass covers of famous songs right at the end of trailers.,7.2
Heretic,Does any one else think hugh grant would mąkę a good mad hatter(Batman villain},7.2
Heretic,idamn id be big as a house if i ate like that,7.2
Heretic,"My my, another movie whose plot is based upon ignoring two well-known theological facts:  That God is invisible and openly declared so by Paul in the bible itself, and that God will let you give him a silly test to get what you want.  Either grab a candlestick and beat Hugh senseless, or sit and wait until you're missed.",7.2
Heretic,"The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:At long last, a Worthy opponent.",7.2

Heretic,"Smh...I had these psychos attack me at the bus stop in Brooklyn last year when I was visiting my mates.. bloody annoying with this Jesus Christ is coming rubbish...😅 And I'm a stealth Catholic and I still can't stand these people. But anyway,this film looks intense.",7.2
Heretic,The title presentation reminded me of 'Alien' a little bit :v,7.2
Heretic,I hope this movie respects the Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS)...,7.2
Heretic,"y el jinete serpiente, los monstruos, donde estan las calaveras o el elfo que disparaba y las referencias a doom? :c yo creia que seria como en el juego",7.2
Heretic,Can’t wait for this movie also saw this trailer when I saw the newest aliens and my dad and he’s girlfriend was interested when they saw this trailer,7.2
Heretic,Plot Twist: They search the whole maze top to bottom looking for that damn pie.,7.2
Heretic,I like this❤️Luv it Hugh Grant is great cast for supervillain,7.2
Heretic,"Well, If they wish us to believe and go through the hoops and hell you have to endure in being a religious person, and accept it, then how about a simple test in reality to 'truly' test their faith... I mean come on, what is a little maze to eternity in hellfire? Right? I bet all religious outliers would love to prove their faith in this little game..",7.2
Heretic,i dont like the trailers  which revelas almost every single plot detail about the movie.,7.2
Heretic,Jesus does save by the way! Don’t be blinded by the coded movie😅,7.2
Heretic,I just hate how I didn't see her climbing a latter,7.2
Heretic,Saw it yesterday was a really good movie different but i wish it was all real.,7.2
Heretic,"High Grant in Notting hill…. Oh terribly sorry 
Hugh in this… oh terribly sorry now you must die",7.2
Heretic,"The ending is deliberately ambiguous, leaving room for different interpretations. The two main characters, Sister Paxton and Sister Barnes, are held captive by a sinister scholar, Mr. Reed, who challenges their faith and manipulates them with theological puzzles. As the story unfolds, the women try to escape and even confront Mr. Reed's cruel beliefs.

At one point, after Reed kills Sister Barnes, Paxton defies his attempts to convince her that they're trapped in a ""simulation."" Ultimately, Paxton manages to stab Reed, but he's not easily defeated. In the film's final moments, just as Paxton seems to succumb to her fate, Sister Barnes mysteriously reappears and kills Reed, allowing Paxton to escape. However, the film closes with a haunting detail—a butterfly fluttering—suggesting that the entire sequence might have been a dream or part of a greater existential question about reality​.",7.2
Heretic,"Absolutely cannot watch this ..I a total shitbag for these types of films 😮
But love that Grant doing different types of roles 
The funny loved up idiot been played out . & He merits more intriguing roles.
His role in the gentleman was excellent 👌",7.2
Heretic,"Not really mormons ""think"" they are christians, The book of mormon and the bible have 2 very different views.",7.2
Heretic,"The butterfly landing on her hand is clearly meant to validate her belief because that butterfly is supposed to be Barnes. I mean it’s not even subtle. It’s not meant to imply that anything was a dream, it was meant to show that her faith and belief are real and that butterfly landing in that exact spot was Sister Barnes communicating from the other side.",7.2
Heretic,"​@FreshSpecimens unless I blinked the butterfly just disappeared, which gave me the idea she might have never left the house.",7.2
Heretic,"We can’t come in unless another woman is present 
I identify as a woman does that count?",7.2
Heretic,How does Hugh Grant keep getting work? Isn’t he a pain in the ass?,7.2
Heretic,"i want to watch but as long as its not demonic? make fun as you wish i just stay away from those type movies, but is this rather more of a thriller, than demonistic? if anyones watched let me know. TIA",7.2
Heretic,I think we're gonna get a mediocre story with some good visual.,7.2
Heretic,"If anyone tells u this is a good movie, they are NOT your friend, and can not be trusted",7.2
Heretic, @tompro53 the fact that it made them consider critical thinking about their faith,7.2
Heretic,Just watched the movie. And absolutely DO NOT recommend watching it. I love movies and go to the cinema a lot. This is the first movie I watched where I was bored watching it 20 mins in. Waste of a cinema ticket,7.2
Heretic,Does their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ come to their salvation?,7.2
Heretic,"I don't understand why people praise this when it is offensive and poses a threat to ALL missionaries, especially sister missionaries.",7.2
Heretic,Something about those Jeffrey Dahmer glasses that can make anyone look creepy.,7.2
Heretic,"This premise and concept blew me away. Although Mormons actually Christian, they do make it seem here like they are, I just hope this isn’t anti Christian because personally it’s boring and over done now",7.2
Heretic,Wanna see this but if ends up just being a Mormon bash it’s gonna suck so far so good,7.2
Heretic,Yall gone realize these white evangelical christians.  Yall better start believing in Gods Grace.  These folks out here real like this,7.2
Heretic,I’ll never support Hugh Grant there’s too many stories about him being a bully and a bad person,7.2
Heretic,Trying to find a movie to watch now at the cinema- thank you for this😂,7.2
Heretic,@NineballChris  I never left. I'm saying only 20 mins in and I got bored watching it,7.2
Heretic,"It portrays the graphically violent treatment of women, including people of faith, and those who provide volunteer service to their communities. Any narrative that promotes violence against women because of their faith or undermines the contributions of volunteers runs counter to the safety and wellbeing of our communities.

This is my main concern. Hollywood gives ideas to people on how to treat service missionaries. 
Violence against women of any Faith should not be promoted even worse for entertainment purposes! Is sickening!",7.2
Heretic,"se esse filme não se chamar ""testemunhas de jeová"" aqui no Brasil eu nem quero kkkk",7.2
Heretic,Looks so good. Love to see him in a role like this. Creepy,7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant playing a new horror villain serial killer looks great for a new horror  film with a great storyline heretic from looks great to watch  in cinemas November 8th 2024 looks Interesting to watch looks like a twisted surreal horror thriller to watch later this year with a twist and clues for a new horror movie,7.2
Heretic,Very creepy film and it looks interesting. Hugh Grant is such a good actor too.,7.2
Heretic,I saw it today and Hugh Grant does not pass for devilish roles at all. I think there s going to be a sequel to it.,7.2
Heretic,Let's hope the Mormons don't get away with something terrible like reality!,7.2
Heretic,So somebody got fed up with door to door witnessing and made a movie to scare a whole religion away ?? 😂,7.2
Heretic,Did you know that more women go to and graduate college than men?,7.2
Heretic,Your ideas have been around for a very long time. Unfortunately America is a free country we don't restrict media like dictatorships do.,7.2
Heretic,If keanu reeves did this heh if u now u know (that movie) hahaa,7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant playing some sick experiment on two girls he playing a game like two mice in a maze but apt weirder,7.2
Heretic,I like to but goddamn I’m sick of the “popular song turned creepy” bs,7.2
Heretic,"Where are the Inquisitors? In the name of the God Emperor, this movie should be purged.",7.2
Heretic,"Spoiler alert! ⚠️

They had two solid fun endings they could go for that would’ve made this movie a lot more memorable: there are actually supernatural shenanigans going on and the guy has god/some godly being in his house, or, he is just a creepy harmless dude who would actually let them out after undergoing these unnerving unhinged trials.

Instead they went for the middle road route of ”crazy guy kidnaps and kills women”, which felt a lot more generic. When he straight up killed the first girl after just being this creepy but harmless instructor guy up until that point (which was an amusing concept honestly), that was just kinda disappointing.",7.2
Heretic,"Wow seems like another new recent good horror movie, that's not the usual, 'my signal is lost' blabla, we shoudld separate to find ways out that kind of crap stories..",7.2
Heretic,"I get your point, and at start I thought the same. However, if you think about it, the way the movie went down was the best option. Not going into any ""magic"" or ""fictional land"", and just keeping the movie as real as possible",7.2
Heretic,"Pay money, waste two hours, then leave feeling sick: the reason we stopped going to Hollywood movies a long time ago.  ❌",7.2
Heretic,Looks like another typical shitty horror/suspense movie that's going to get rated 6.4/10 on IMDb.,7.2
Heretic,Sow anxious to see it all buy too tickets to see it 2 time or even more ❤ love psychopath movies  😂 funny how I'm diagnosed with homocidal togths and going to see movies like this makes me feel better never mind all buy 4 tickets and see it 4 times 🎉,7.2
Heretic,There's real shit like that really happing to people that go missing!! Games just Games to the rick and dark!,7.2
Heretic,What a waste of time movie! Also the idea behind it is a waste of thier time to who ever made the movie 😂,7.2
Heretic,"Sorry but GOD said to listen to HIM, and not any of the changed a million times over the last few thousands years of scripture they CANNONIZED.  HE said it's kinda like when you play that game telephone  where you whisper something into the person next to you and they whisper it to their neighbor and so on and so on until it's back to you and it's nothing like the words you originally spoke.",7.2
Heretic,So belief door is horrendous shit right? 😂 because if you have faith and believe in God you shouldn't be scared or worried 😂😂,7.2
Heretic,This piece of junk made from molds for suspense films can only be saved from oblivion by the great Hugh Grant.,7.2
Heretic,"why do all of the crazy people have cool, old houses...",7.2
Heretic,"Hugh was having only crap movies, maybe this time there’s a hope.",7.2
Heretic,Funny. Real life guy and his wife gave lds sister missionaries weed cookies. They went all lesbian on each other ha ha.,7.2
Heretic,I'm sorry but Hugh Grant in a horror film is sorta comical to me. Kinda like watching Adam Sandler play a serial killer.,7.2
Heretic,"“Heretic”2024movie makes me think of the so-called 🧐“murder castle” of the serial killer H.H.Holmes,in a way.",7.2
Heretic,Imagine Evangelism who support Trump is visiting Trump home. Thats what happen to them now,7.2
Heretic,Let’s not forget how Adam Sandler shocked us all with his very serious performance in Uncut Gems….,7.2
Heretic,"Yawn, this guy AGAIN? Is he the only actor still acting?",7.2
Heretic,Lol I know it doesn't say it but it clearly implies these are lds people. It's not offensive or anything but like seriously 😂😂😂,7.2
Heretic,Parang yung pag iisip ni Hugh dito collective 🧠 ng Zios/Jewish.Trew?,7.2
Heretic,No one on the entire crew could direct these girls to the bike ramp conveniently located on the side of the stairs but I'm supposed to believe they could hatch a clever plot? That's bout as believable as the silly device concealed by the light switch.,7.2
Heretic,"No, no, no! I do not want to see Hugh Grant in a psycho role. No. That irresistible smile only belongs in rom coms.",7.2
Heretic,One of them actually does use it but the shots not in the trailer but still strange they both don't use,7.2
Heretic,😂😂 you have no clue. Just crying in ur little corner about nothing,7.2
Heretic,"Most boring movie I’ve ever seen, the trailer is so misleading. I literally fell asleep half way through watching this",7.2
Heretic,How do white people know every actor's first and last name? I just say the guy/chick in that one movie/show.,7.2
Heretic,I watched this last night. Even the conversations are unsettling. Good psychological horror.,7.2
Heretic,Maybe the mormons and Jehova Witnesses will stop knocking on my door now.,7.2
Heretic,Thats why you shouldn’t knock on random peoples door and ask them if they believed in Jesus Christ.,7.2
Heretic,"I didn’t really understand the candle everyone is talking about, only until
 I read the comments; I guess 🤷‍♀️",7.2
Heretic,Horrible movie about an annoying atheist with nothing better to do than harass religious folks,7.2
Heretic,"As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I just wanted to say that this movie misrepresents what missionaries do and the things that they go through on their missions. This is just Hollywood playing off of stereotypes about the church. Nothing wrong with making a movie, just wanted to point out the misrepresentation. Our missionaries volunteer to serve their missions and through their service and sacrifice in the name of the Lord, God will always be with them to protect and help them in times of need.",7.2
Heretic,THEY NEED TO PUT JESUS MIGHTY NAME OUT OF HORROR AND VIOLENCE MOVIES.,7.2
Heretic,Protect them from emotions. It won’t protect them from a physical threat.,7.2
Heretic,@ through God anything is possible. God will protect all his children who follow his teachings. I believe that with all my heart from experience.,7.2
Heretic,@ That’s a stretch to say the half million boys who were humped by priest didn’t follow God teachings. I would have thought they were protected like spiritually or emotionally. No one was there to protect them physically.,7.2
Heretic,@ I can’t speak on behalf of other churches. Wish all the best to whoever was wronged and pray that God will comfort them🙏,7.2
Heretic,Did you actually see this movie? I somehow doubt it because it did not misrepresent anything.,7.2
Heretic,"@the portrayal of sister missionaries was a little over the top. The way they interacted with other people was too robotic in the movie. That’s all, they’re just like everybody else 🤷‍♂️",7.2
Heretic," @themesscrew7  you know honey, I really hate to bring it on but the world is little bigger than you know",7.2
Heretic,At 6 foot 5 and 250 pounds trained in mma ..... why can't this happen to me,7.2
Heretic,"Having seen the film, I don’t remember when the two sisters attempting to convert others. They must have cut these.",7.2
Heretic,I have zero idea if this is good or not from the ever so generic trailer,7.2
Heretic,"I see A24 keep making 39-minute ""Outer Limits"" episodes into way too long movies , because people keep buying it.",7.2
Heretic,"REVIEW WITH MINIMAL SPOILERS: 

I saw this movie its bad. like bad bad. for some reason the trailer is so much cooler. i thought it was going to be an elaborate house maze where the girls are being chased by some monster (the miracle) and they have to get through the maze while their faith is tested. wrong... its just a boring super disappointing not very scary movie that's more cringy, gross and sad than anything else. 

I'm not Mormon, but i like horror a lot. love hugh grant, but the endless monologues are a pain to sit through. the character's hyperfixated on his cynicism and he just talks the entire movie. you know that feeling where the villain cannot stop talking about their evil plan? that's this character. it makes for a fun intro but after the 30 minute mark it's like he just keeps following them ranting. then it just spirals into violence in a really clumsy way. 1/10",7.2
Heretic,Hugh Grant is boring man why tf they use him for this role?,7.2
Heretic,"Just saw. Awful movie. Dark, demonic, creepy, death and destruction. Slit throats, stomach stabbing, caged women. Awful. Not clever in the slightest.",7.2
Heretic,"Is A24, I been burn too many times with their horrible movies, no using my money on A24.",7.2
Heretic,"No, I don't watch such ""ingenious"" works of art when you are shown that you aren't smart enough to guess what the author wants to show you.  Sorry!",7.2
Heretic,My friend didn't care for it.. said it couldn't hold his attention,7.2
Heretic,who fucken says there are no ORIGINAL ideas in HOLLYWOOD!... THIS!!,7.2
Heretic,Clever movies are not in demand and never will be. We are devolving already..,7.2
Heretic,That sounds like a great movie to me. Now I gotta go see it.. thank you,7.2
Heretic,"By rule, Does that mean you have to get a new friend or the friend has to pick the next movie? :)",7.2
Heretic,i hope its a thing about god that hes useless. that would be awesome.,7.2
Heretic,"Eh is it scary if no one dies, both females will emerge alive. Females beat Freddy, Jason, Art the Clown, and now Hugh Grant",7.2
Heretic,The movie was great. I think that most from the negative comments here come from the mormons fanatics,7.2
Heretic,I thought it was one of the worst horror movies ever it was so boring and nothing really happened,7.2
Heretic,Looks horrible. Why would anyone ever want to watch this. Ha ha 😂,7.2
Heretic,Interesting…aside from the fact that Hugh Grant is about the LEAST intimidating man on the planet earth. Especially with that accent.,7.2
Heretic,"It has a horror ""Life of Pi"" feel to it. I think the horror is about do you believe in faith?",7.2
Heretic,"let me guess, this will be a ""Christianity bad"" movie and the girls will lose their faith by the end of it.
tiresome.",7.2
Heretic,One of the worst movies I’ve seen this year. Pointless. Someone fell asleep in the cinema and literally snored the whole movie,7.2
Heretic,It doesn’t seem that way. It seems most of the negative comments are from people who wanted this to be a heavily supernatural movie. I thought this movie was awesome. 🎉,7.2
Heretic,They’re all the same there hasn’t been a good horror in years,7.2
Heretic, @nimanixo  but this one was really the worst it wasnt scary or anything it was just disgussing religion and the main guy just does everything to change up the mind of these girls,7.2
Heretic," @KingOfGreece  Wrong actually, since the movie isn't out yet and we dont know.",7.2
Heretic, @gypsygypsy2551  well it is out in the uk I watched it yesterday,7.2
Heretic,"What a horrible boring movie. Listening to Hugh Grant's monologue for 2 hours, no suspense, no horror, just verbal diarrhea.",7.2
Heretic,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!
For anyone who has seen this movie now that it is out… was anyone else very disappointed with the twist that the whole thing was a trick? Like, wouldn’t it have been much more compelling of a story had this guy ACTUALLY figured out something supernatural?",7.2
Heretic,This is great! This should stop the religious nuts knocking on our doors! 😂,7.2
Heretic,"I saw this movie tonight (12-1-2024) expecting to be frightened... what a HUGE disappointment!!

I should have gone on the swan boats with my granddaughter 😢",7.2
Heretic,"great footage buls$it horror for kids, what a waist what cinema is facing in 2024",7.2
Heretic,Absolutely rubbish movie made me fall asleep! Dont waste your time,7.2
Heretic,"I just saw the movie. Both my boyfriend and I were disappointed.  It’s nice to see Hugh Grant in a different genre, but honestly it was not very exciting. He fell asleep He fell at least 4 or 5 times.  I had to keep poking him to wake him up.  It’s a sleeper horror flic.",7.2
Heretic,"I DONT RECOMMEND THE MOVIE
HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED… 
People go and see the movie due to the actor but is very bad 
Don’t waste your money in cinema",7.2
Heretic,"HOLLYWOOD HAS GONE MAD
ALL THESE SICH PSYCHO NEGATIVE MOVIES ONE AFTER ANOTHER
DISGUSTING",7.2
Heretic,Not sure how Yt people took the Bible and tried to make it their own when Jesus only came for the Israelites (Blacks Hispanics and native Americans) it’s quite pathetic honestly.,7.2
Heretic,I agree lol. I had to try really hard to stay invested in the movie,7.2
Heretic,"I agree, could’ve been a lot better had it went that route. Saw it last night.",7.2
Heretic,I was super glad it did NOT go that route. But that’s probably because supernatural movies do not scare me.,7.2
Heretic," @FreshSpecimens  The point wouldn't have been to ""scare you"" though. The point would've been the cosmic mystery of the situation and the idea that every religion was wrong about the true meaning/ creator of life. To find out that all the evil in the world only exists NOT because God gave us free will and some ppl are just bad.. but the idea that the true creator of all things is dark and twisted itself.

Heretic," @CATTingle To me, that is not particularly interesting. But that’s fine, everyone likes different things.",7.2
Heretic," @CATTingle Also, I’m not necessarily saying the point of the movie is to scare me but it’s a horror movie so I imagine being scary is at least SOME of the intent of the filmmaker. If the movie ultimately went more of the Longlegs route I would not have found it as creepy. But whackadoodles like Mr Reed really exist and to me that IS creepy.",7.2
Heretic," @CATTingle Did you see Longlegs? I just realized I probably should not have commented about that one with  borderline spoilers. If you saw it, did you like it?",7.2
Heretic,"@ I did see Longlegs and I didn’t like the supernatural route they took. But that was bc they didn’t set it up to seem supernatural. It wasn’t advertised that way nor did it seem like it was going that way. That’s why I was disappointed with THIS movie. It seemed like it was going the supernatural route, but then hard cut into it all being some magic trick. I get subverting expectations and plot twists, but it felt like they were switching genres halfway through",7.2
Heretic, @CATTingle Haha. I liked Longlegs until the supernatural stuff came up. I still think overall it was an okay movie and had some truly creepy moments but I wish that stuff had not happened.,7.2
Heretic,This movie is absolutely not horror for kids. If you saw the movie you would know that.,7.2
Heretic,I am not a big fan of Hugh Grant but he was really good in it. Nothing disappointing about this movie. I highly recommend it.,7.2
Heretic,I’m so glad you let us know. We were all wondering if you liked it. lol.,7.2

TheAmateur, @Quarthon  they are all Elliot’s personalities of course but the Mr. Robot personality is portrayed by Christian Slater. Hacker Elliot we follow the majority of the show is the “Mastermind.” The Mother and the Child are other personalities. We get almost no time with real Elliot until the very end of the series.,3.0

TheAmateur,"I hope you realize that was the purpose of trailers, they ""trailed"" the movie by showing snippets of the story AFTER you've watched it. Showing trailers before the movie comes out is a modern twist, and a shitty one at that.",3.0

TheAmateur,Rami Malek as the lead in The Amateur? This man has already blown our minds as Elliot in Mr. Robot and made us believe he was Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. The trailer kinda feels like a movie version of Mr. Robot series and thats one more reason to look forward to it!,3.0
TheAmateur,"Thanks for uploading the entire movie 6 months ahead, 20th Century! :)",3.0
TheAmateur,It IS a remake of .... THE AMATEUR. It is a great movie from 1981 with John Savage. I think it might have been the first of the CIA revenge movies. It has a 100% similar scene ( the best one from the original ) of an assassination in a pool. It looks great / a definite must see.,3.0

TheAmateur,"​ @Lominen  Hear me out tho, 'body cam footage' in itself, cannot be put in that manner, you could say it's a body cam recording, but if the word footage was put into this sentence it would have to lose the 'a' = ""it's body cam footage."". Makes no sense when you say ""I found 'a' footage of you cheating on me"". Because given what I've understood through formal use of the word footage, English users' treat it as a collective noun. (Mind you I'm not not a professor or anything, I only teased him about his incorrect English because his reply to my comment signaled to me his intellectual range comes a bit short, as he seemingly misunderstood my intent in that comment, and tried to frame it as tho I am the one who is undereducated)",3.0
TheAmateur," @g.o.d.s.e.y.e100  You're right. I didn't read that line with a broader perspective and therefore failed to recognize the mistake. (Also, thanks for giving me new information— I never knew the word footage would exclude the usage of 'a' before it)

TheFallGuy,"Not at all. This is the death of his career. He went from being a unique actor in a sea of look-alikes.

TheFallGuy,"​@b1gb1rd96  I was about to comment ""how would you know???"" (High five to ya!)",8.0
TheFallGuy,No studio would ever allow the main character to do his own stunts (with exceptions). They would lose a lot of money through delays in case the actor got hurt or injured and needed to be replaced. None of this applies to stuntment. And then there is the question of insurance companies who would not like it either. 🤷,8.0
TheFallGuy, @onemaninaboat  Studios do that all the time. They just do all the stunts at the end of the shoot so that if the actor gets hurt they can still finish it. Ron Howard almost drowned Tom Hanks.,8.0

TheFallGuy,"Just want to mention how fucking GREAT Atomic Blonde was, one of Leitch’s earlier films, remember watching it in the theatre, a really nice mix of classic Le Carré British cold war spy thriller novel, and the classic long-take action that Leitch is known for, in that case where there’s less kung-fu and more ‘realistic’ wear and tear and tiredness.

TheFallGuy,"I can tell you don't understand how stunt doubles work or the fact that this is based on an old TV show. I'm pretty sure he made this film for the exact same reasons he had for every other film he's made.

TheFallGuy," @truffleshuffle009  Been rewatching it the last few weeks, He's a stuntman that's hired out by ""Jack"" to bring back bail jumpers, the only mystery is where they ran off to and how to get them. The crime part is insinuated in the bail jumping part.",8.0
TheFallGuy, @freakbiker  then you have not watched enough. There are always mysteries and stuff they were trying to figure out it was not just about bounty hunting and figuring out where the person went. For instant one episode that comes to mind is the one Howie got to be the main stunt man and got hurt. There was accident and they figured out someone sniped the tire on the truck. They had to figure out why and who and stuff like that. Another one was something about fake aliens and lights. Apparently there was going to be a remake that more closely followed the show but that fell through in 2020. Then this one came along that is loosely based on it.,8.0

My comment will age fine, because I dont believe this film will be any good. Just because Lee Majors makes a cameo, doesn't mean this film will have any quality. Hes obviously just doing it for the fans. If you dont like my opinion, fine. It is however MY opinion and Im entitled to it. Agree to disagree.",8.0
TheFallGuy," @peterlenham3180  Because you're judging a film that's not even released yet? That's why your comment is ridiculous. When the film is out, then I'll judge it. I'm not judging a film off a trailer, how bloody ridiculous.",8.0
TheFallGuy," @acurisur  I highly doubt it will be much better when it's released, but Im happy to be proven wrong. It just seems to be going for the style of the show, and it aint working for me.

TheFallGuy,"Perfectly cast with Ryan and Emily. I would love to see a 5 minute cameo with Lee Majors from the original Fall Guy series somewhere in the movie, where the title idea came from. The writers used a few ideas of the series, the big truck jumping, the name Jodi in the movie, the cowboy hat, and sheer humor of being a fall guy with lots of action, having fist fights a lot. Yeah, I know there is a lot different from a show decades ago too. Ryan and Emily, 2 very bankable stars these days!",8.0

TheFallGuy,"This is a movie based off the 80s TV show ""Fall Guy"" with Lee Majors",8.0
TheFallGuy,Why does everybody take it so serious. Like this is so obvious satire 💀💀,8.0
TheFallGuy," @robertshiell887  It's as close as it should be. Stuntmen of Lee Major's generation would've come up in their careers making Westerns, like Cliff Booth in Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. That movie was set in 1969, and that whole part of Hollywood was dying off. By 1980 nobody was making Westerns in any major way.

In 2023, the world of Hollywood stuntwork is completely different. David Leitch, the director of this movie, worked as a stunt man like Colt Seavers. He was Brad Pitt's stunt double on several movies. He has over eighty credits for stuntwork, and not a single one is working on a Western. Lots of science fiction and action movies though.

Just as The Fall Guy tv series and its characters reflected the time the show was released and what life was like for stuntmen then, this movie and its versions of the characters reflects our time and what stuntwork is like for the people doing it for a living now.",8.0

TheFallGuy,"As a fan of the original, I hope the cast and script don't disappoint but frankly, I'm not seeing anything positive in the trailer. Aside from highlighting stunt work of course. It looks generic, flat and another time when Hollywood simply tries to cash in on an IP. Trailers can be misleading though and it is a good cast, so I'll keep my eye on it.",8.0
TheFallGuy,It's not paying homage to the stunt men it's cashing in on an 80s TV series and not doing it very either,8.0

TheFallGuy,"Great movie, I love it! There's everything: love, action (great action indeed!), fun, moral teaching, and I just adore the soundtrack, my songs from the 80s revisited. I sang along all the time! Blunt and Gosling are supercool and the chemistry between them is strong, the director Leitch is simply a genius in the way he orchestrated all the scenes, which are supported by novel ideas in both the sequence and the effects and insight into the characters' personality. This movie is going to be my movie🧡",8.0

TheFallGuy,"I'm with you 100%, just a fun movie with some action and a love story.",8.0

It’s so incredibly fun, exhilarating, inspiring, funny, massive, touching, heartfelt, awe inspiring, loving, daring, extremely well written and performed and made. It’s a complete and utter blast. I smiled legit the entire movie. And so far seen it twice. It’s everything a movie should be. Absolutely perfect for the theater, I wanna seen it everyday till it leaves. It’s just so cool. So fun. I absolutely loved the film! Loved learning and seeing this side of movies. I want to be a stunt performer now! 

It’s become such a bright spot in my life right now. 
I wish I could explain better how amazing this film is and how much it means to me. 
The music is incredible.
The credits. The beginning, middle, and end. The twists. The action. The comedy. The romance. From the very moment it started (that pre film texting clip included!) to the very moment it ended. A perfect film. 

I’m so grateful for these guys, for everyone who made this movie, for stunt performers. Thank you for stunts. Thank you for this. Thank you for what you do. Thank you for in a small part doing it for us. I’m eternally grateful. And thank you for this movie. It’s absolute blast and new all time favorite.

TheFallGuy, @bossfan49  Every time the remake a show into a movie they kind of make it a parody. Generally 100% of the time I hate that but I'm going to give Ryan a chance strictly because I enjoyed him in that Netflix action movie.

Mr Lee Majors himself . It was great to see him again even though he was at the end of the movie and I'm guessing that must have been Heather Thomas besides him . I didn't wish to see the credits or the bloopers if there was any . Sorry Hollywood but two thumbs down  . If I was to turn this movie on again I would start it at the end with Lew Majors and skip the rest . The Pee Wee herman movie was better than this and I can't stand pee wee herman but in order to make my wife happy I watched the dumb thing . Ryan what's your name , please stick to the barbie doll movie everybody was talking about that you were in . I might give Ryan a chance if he decided to play Fred from Scooby Doo but sorry I DID NOT like this fall guy movie. Lee Majors , Heather Thomas , Douglas Barr and Markie Post ROCKS  !!!

TheFallGuy,"This movie is terrible. He gets hurt and she's making it all about her, to where she is using her professional position to physically abuse him and repeatedly put him through stunts he doesn't need to be doing, the exact thing that got him hurt in the first place, extraneous stunt takes. 

Then she makes the whole thing a public affair in front of a whole cast and crew on set. Using her position to humiliate him and force him into a private and personal conversation publicly and on megaphones too. Wasting time and money on a production she was complaining about the time on. 

I thought this movie was going to be about a stunt man who somehow got wrapped up in a real-life caper where he'd have to save her and himself from some nefarious plot by some gangsters stealing something. Instead, it's a horribly sexist, rom-com wannabe rip off of an idea done much better before. 

I don't think I'm 20 minutes in and I hate everything about this movie. Had to turn it off, I deserve better. 

What needed to be extended on this cut of the movie? i think you fit in all the snarky, disrespectful, bullying sexism in her character, are you saying there was more. Gross!

TheFallGuy,Okay I get what they're doing it's pretty cool that they're doing a movie of The Fall Guy which is a TV show one of the best TV shows ever but after looking at the trailer I can tell it's going to be a flip-flop messed up movie it's not going to have all the right characters which they already got the wrong characters for the film that don't even fit the script of the Fall Guy I figured that it would be just the way it was as the TV show no matter how much they try to do remix of old TV shows for a movie they always end up missing it up destroying the image of the TV show in the TV show was much better than this movie here but I think I'm going to have to give it probably won't start one thumb up I can already tell it's going to be a sloppy movie with sloppy characters they don't even fit the same characters as the TV show the storyline is all messed up completely but I'll give it a chance check it out and see if it's any good but I think that they need to leave the old TV shows alarm I mean they messed up this one dukes of hazzard's chips now they want to do a remake of Smokey and the bandit which they did and they destroyed the image of Smokey and the bandit every single TV show did they put on scream they destroyed the image of the TV show so now we got another flip-flop movie that's probably looks pretty interesting I wouldn't mind watching it but you cannot steal the power of the Fall Guy of the TV show the TV show is still number one is still the best and it's better than this lot that they're fixing to do right now I can't wait to see it we'll give it a chance,8.0

The whole film’s just about showing off the stunts from the beginning to the end and let all stuntmen shine cuz they deserve it.

Is by definition  it destroys suspension of disbelieve..my wife hates...we tried to watch lala land and she could only last 5mins..and the reasons is the songs drags you out of believing this has some semblance of reality..

In reality  this thing would never happen...everyone would never get  up and just start sing the Same song and dance together...a 80s action  movie is more grounded in reality..

I don't say he is a classic criminal, ""mastermind.""  If you're just saying he doesn't precisely match that one-dimensional take on the classic character, I agree.   But the initial depiction could very-well be a high-iq individual (and thus a different, ""flavor,"" of the classic character) and I guess I just think it's concerning/disappointing/irritating(?) to see so many pigeonhole so many others who don't fit some exact archetypal preconception.

I'm not exactly sure why your experience has caused you to feel you can easily narrow the behavioral field of every single high iq individual with such pinpoint precision, but my lowly incidental exp simply differs.
 100% honesty, one of the (purportedly) highest iq individuals I know is a kindly, hippy-ish, ""bum.""  My family despises him for (again, purportedly) squandering his, ""gifts.""  It's like a well-worn story that circulates around in our family at various get togethers (lol)- how incredible his potential was as someone tested in the top 1 percentile and where he is.


I guess I just lowkey-object to narrow preconceptions that are SO EXTREMELY prevalent today from one extreme to the other.

TheJoker," @hoobadoobamaster8551  probably because the first movie was a critic to society and still idolizing an assassin without the idea isn't a good thing to do. It explains to stop idolizing people because they are human, and if the character of Arthur was your neighbor instead of someone famous you would have a definitely different idea of him. Idk but i think the fact you should hate this movie was in the advertisement they gave. People usually just follow. But yeah, I really liked the first movie but I think this is even more better in making fun of the average viewer and another, even worse critic to social media society and all the crazy people and ideas it gave space",6.0

So, yes, people who love the crazy, absurd, illogical, over the top version of the Joker we see in the comics and most media may have felt disappointed with a movie wich with no shame reminds us such a character is a terrible influence, the worst possible model to follow, and basically a shitty human being, and not a romantic ideal of freedom, chaos and anarchy.

And the the real audience reaction to it is the perfect companion piece to the movie.

No one fucking cares about Arthur fleck and his struggles, all want to see the ""rise of joker"".

The movie and the first was never about how the joker came to be, it's about how a troubled man becomes the joker, I do criticize the lost ambiguity of the first film but other then that it's a solid 7.2-7.6 drama movie about a troubled man, the pressures of society, celebrity, toxic woman and relationships, about infatilization of physopath, violence and troubled people, making them like its fun and yeaaa when it's fucking depressing.

Arthur is a tragic man that no one looks at, and even the movie audiences showed exactly that.

I think it's hard to get many chances, because usually when the film is a box office hit, they don't go back to deconstruct and possibly change it, or its part of a trilogy potential, so it's not meant to be a final say.   The closest I can think of, is from Pitch Black, having a Vin Diesel as Riddick being a loner trying to survive amongst monsters, to Chronicles of Riddick, expanding the universe with great visuals, and giving Riddick a brand new back story with Oedipus-like prophecy, with new non-monster enemies.

The original, wasn't Joker, or certainly good comics Joker!   And it was a terrible message, for those who treated his type of murderous loser anarchy as righteous. So may be it's all well and good that Todd Phillips is correcting that erroneous impression, in a surprising way.    I'm not offended, because I rather disliked the first Joker movie.   And Gary's made fun of Disney elevating Cruella and other dislikable villains. Want a good Joker movie--watch the Dark Knight, or the animated ""Return of the Joker"".  Those are both amazing, and hardly a negative when Batman saves the day against his worst adversary.  I'm fine with that.",6.0

Heck, it could be where the old Arthur fleck perhaps comes sprinkled in at this point as a minor personality trait of the Joker with the film really that side of him becomes fully extinguished where just as much as Harley becomes entangled with the Joker, she is what helps for that sympathetic side of the Joker to become burried away behind his more psychotic side.

2. Yeah, same as she always is?

Arthur sees that at best he will have to turn into a monster on the run who he doesn't recognize anymore, and he's sick of being used and tortured by everyone around him, so he stops pretending that he's the Joker from that cartoon in the beginning, and goes back to being himself, and then everyone INCLUDING YOU discarded him and stopped caring about him.

The point isn't that Arthur was a loser or awful or anything like that... It's that you are. The point is that you are a worthless loser who never cared about Arthur, just the Joker.

Its why the idea of resetting Arthur back looks even stranger. Why would Harley even be attracted to him?

Todd Phillips is a hack director who only makes dumb comedies and very basic documentaries.
But he accidentally struck gold with ""The Joker"" by just ripping off two Martin Scorsese films and attempting to figure out why those movies worked.
Joker 2 fails because he was trying his own thing instead of ripping off more highly acclaimed films.

""Drive"" had a similar situation, it was a film made by a really shitty director that somehow gained a large audience.
And all it did was ripoff ""The Driver"" and ""Thief"" without fully understanding why those two films worked.

After the success of ""Drive"", the director made a spiritual successor reusing Ryan Gosling in a similar style action movie and it flopped hard.
Critics and audiences hated it.
The director has never made a good movie before or after ""Drive"".
This is likely because his new film wasn't ripping off any successful movies, it was trying to be it's own thing while being inspired by ""what he thought"" worked in ""Drive"".",6.0

First movie was the transition from Arthur to Joker. Second should take that to the next step of how Joker is a master manipulator, and how he will mess with your head for no other reason just for a laugh or as a agent of chaos that can't really be contained.

the fact we saw arthur as sympathetic, and as a note about how the world fails mental health victims, and feel some catharsis at his outburst and shift to the joker, made todd phillips incredibly angry.

TheJoker,"​ @nymphey the movie is not at all anti-white male. Its about mental health. Arthur is just a guy with a very sad life, you were never supposed to idolise him, he was not a criminal genious. Hes clearly not the Batman Joker. The movie makes it perfectly clear.",6.0
TheJoker," @goncalodias6402  What makes you think people idolized him, or thought he was a criminal genius? 
He was a downtrodden, disabled, mentally ill abuse victim, who got kicked repeatedly by society, and eventually cracked. That there is a form of catharsis that stems from seeing a character like that feel triumphant for a second, does not equal either support for his behavior or anything resembling idolization. 
Also, of course he's not ""The Joker."" The Batman related bits were shoehorned into the first movie (because it's the only way they could get it made), and there's already a half dozen or so non-comics Jokers that were actually part of a Batman story, and they're very different from each other. Most people figured out it was a stand-alone character study with an unreliable narrator and enjoyed it for what it was.  No sequel was planned, there was no need to make a sequel, and using it to remove the ambiguities of the original was a stupid decision. And I actually like both Lady Gaga and musicals.",6.0
TheJoker, @unfilthy  but did that make this movie bad? Its a good movie,6.0
TheJoker," @goncalodias6402 nobody expected him to garner a ton of strength and start beating Batman

People liked the first movie because it was a disabled man beaten down by life while still trying to remain positive until he finally broke.

TheJoker,"His salary was 20 million, and Gaga's was 12 million. So even without their paydays Joker 2 would still have cost over a 100 million higher than Joker. I don't know why it was that much, but there's a Variety interview with Phillips from August 20 where he is awfully defensive about it when they bring it up, and he doesn't give an explanation. That may indicate it wasn't intentional and the budget got away from him.

TheJoker,"A greater version of the movie:

Arthur ends up going to his trial at the start of the film and the sequence with the bomb explosion and escape kicks off the introduction, with hints that his future admirer Harleen Quinzel was involved with the planning. He ends up disappearing alongside his admirer and dark legends form around him and his character, seen through various sources. 

Years later, Bruce Wayne becomes Batman and as he searches for the infamous clown prince of crime following rumors of him resurfacing amid vicious criminal acts made in his name, some of the points made on the list are better explored:

-We could see various reactions in the criminal world alongside the effects of the misaimed fandom (with some of the characters being really dangerous and needed to be locked away while others are just misguided or see relevant points Arthur made when questioned).

-Harvey Dent could have gone insane from the aftermath of the bomb ruining his face years later after so much time passed with not getting mental aid and instead of fighting him during a hostage standoff, the Dark Knight would manage to help calm him down and get him the help he needed like that scene from the animated Dark Knight Returns film, showing some sincere optimism and hope in a world still mostly grim.

-When Batman visits the jails where Arthur was held, flashbacks from the Jokers perspective play out (with questions as to who`s version was true like Rashamon, as various news reports with possible bias are also shown, further drawing some events into question leading up to Jokers escape as well as how it affected his state of mind afterwards).

-Arthur's role in the shadows would explore some other themes like the burdens of fame (as a disillusioned fan would stab him like the real film, only for Arthur to turn the tables on him and murder him, showing moments where he was as deranged as his other versions), toxic relations (as Harleens negative influence is subtle yet obviously creating a vicious circle between her and her love, which also ends with Harleens fate in question) as well as show how all the violence he commits takes a toll on what`s left of what he feels is his inner humanity. At times, you`re left wondering just who Arthur is now in his new identity (as he even has moments where he openly renounces the Joker only to easily give into temptation and slip right back in, feeling that society still has its effect on him and it's the only way to truly live with purpose).

-The ending would have a riot take place in Gotham following the Jokers recapture and another escape and would end on a tall rooftop between him and Batman after a tense chase, with it basically being a homage to The Killing Jokes ending. The final shot would officially end with Batman leaving Jokers body on a cop car before leaving the now subdued chaos setting (as there was questionable moments where it looked like Batman may or may not have earlier broke his no killing rule had Joker been then and there, yet Arthur was also suicidal and looked like he could`ve jumped himself or consumed something fatal earlier, with the poison catching up to him hours later).",6.0

5. Have you ever considered how a film can convey complex emotional states in an enjoyable way?   (Hint:  voiceovers suck.)

6. Did you bother to sit through the credits and listen to the tone of the end-credit music?

8. Did you notice the various ways EVERYONE wanted Joker? Did you notice how that relates to everyone's attitude towards Arthur in the first film? 

9.  Were you paying close enough attention to the ending to notice that it is NOT lore breaking?

So, if you hated the film and answered ""no"" to any of my 9 questions, then all I can do is paraphrase Arthur Fleck: you got what you fucking deserved.




[SPOILERS!!!]





2:29 WRONG.  This is a REALISTIC portrayal of Gotham.  Batman's Joker isn't going to appear fully formed out of the blue in a realistic Gotham.  The Joker is a VERY specific kind of crazy.  It makes far more sense that Batman's Joker is inspired by a proto-Joker.  When you add in the presence of Lee (Harley), it makes even more sense.  Lee was incredibly disappointed in Arthur.  When she finds out Arthur is dead, she is absolutely going to be interested in who killed him.  What do you think Lee is going to do?  Perhaps get hired as a psychiatrist at Arkham, and mold this young man?  IMO, the only realistic way to get Batman's Joker is to have him molded by Lee.  This new Joker would likely be everything she dreams of, which will cause her to overlook the eventual abuse.

2:43 Exactly how media literate can you be and not realize that there are VERY FEW WAYS to convey complex emotional states in cinema.  And of those ways, how many are actually entertaining?  There's voiceovers like you had in David Lynch's Dune.  You can use obscure color palettes that most people won't catch onto. You can put insanely obscure objects in the background Stanley Kubrick-style.  Or you can take a page from the Golden Age of cinema and use song and dance.  It really does feel like the people bitching about the musical numbers are like children screaming that they got a Kobe ribeye steak instead of the hamburger they ordered.

3:07 Joker (2019) was OOZING with mental health themes.  Did you think the sequel would be different?  The way the two films are set up, you can't understand Batman's Joker until you understand Arthur Fleck.  When Joker: folie à deux was announced, did you bother finding out what folie à deux is?  Did you wonder if Arthur's illnesses were things that exist in real life?  Probably not.  I've heard from so many people that what they expected was Joker and Harley rampaging across Gotham.  They probably thought ""folie à deux"" was just a hoity toity way of saying ""part 2"".  The animation before the film absolutely should have clued you into what to expect.

3:35 WRONG. The prosecution's case is that the Joker and Arthur Fleck are the SAME PERSON.  It is ONLY the defense that is trying to push the split personality defense. 

4:28  How do you have a sympathetic Joker and a villainous Joker at the same time?  You make them two distinct people (not personalities) and have one inspired by the other.  Joker (2019) was entirely about society does to Arthur Fleck.  Joker: folie à deux IS ALSO entirely about what society does to Arthur Fleck.  This was NEVER about showing Batman's Joker.  It was entirely about showing what a shitshow Gotham is, which is absolutely a mirror of the real world.

4:45 In case you're too lazy to do a google search, ""folie à deux"" used to be a psychiatric diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. I believe it was removed after version III-R and replaced with ""shared psychotic disorder"".)  In psychology, a ""psychotic episode"" simply means a break from reality.  Hallucinations can absolutely be part of a psychotic episode.  There are times when Lee was certainly there.  There are times when she probably wasn't there.  There are times when Lee was there but what we see on the screen is Arthur's distorted perception of what actually happened.

5:14 ""Flattened affect"" is what you're describing.  It can be seen in schizophrenia, autism, and (most importantly for this film) PTSD.

5:57 The presence of Lee (Harley Quinn) doesn't make this a Joker & Harley Quinn film.  It's an easy mistake to make.  After all, Lee does show up a lot in the film.  BUT, look at how often she ACTUALLY appears, and how often she appears in Arthur's head.  Like Joker (2019), this film is about Arthur Fleck.

6:12 I actually experienced folie à deux for several months in the early 1990's.  (Unlike Arthur, mine was the folie imposée subtype.)  At the end of the trial, Arthur displays EXACTLY what I felt when the folie à deux was over:  guilt, shame, resignation, depression and a deep desire to tell the world everything that happened.  (Obviously I still have that to a certain degree.)  

Like Arthur, I also experienced childhood abuse, and severe trauma as an adult.  I spent 24 years living at 100% the Federal Poverty Level.  I spent a decade living with my father who has failing health.  I was misdiagnosed with depression for 28 years, and my PTSD wasn't diagnosed for 30.  The VA kept feeding me MULTIPLE antidepressants for my bipolar depression, which ACTIVELY made the bipolar worse.  I have been an involuntary celibate for 27 years due to mental illness.  In the 2000's, I lost public mental health care because of budget cuts.  I see how people avoid me like I have the plague when my bipolar mania kicks in and I start talking too fast or saying too many personal things.

I believe that when people have time to get past being butthurt over there being musical numbers and that Arthur is not Batman's Joker, I think they'll realize that Joker and Joker: folie à deux are just as brilliant as Fight Club and Mr. Robot at showing what it feels like to have severe mental illness.

So, I don't believe that this was a deconstruction of Arthur Fleck.  I'll admit there was a little dishonesty in how the film was marketed.  If they had been completely honest, they would have titled it ""Arthur Fleck:  The man who inspired Joker"" parts 1 and 2.

It is sad that so many people have little empathy for those with mental illness.  

Note that I said ""empathy"" and not ""sympathy"".  It does take a little work and imagination to put yourself in someone else's shoes.  

I can't help but wonder how many fans of the first film actually empathized with Arthur.  I suspect most people were too busy reveling in the ""fuck you, society"" to feel any empathy for a person whose entire life legitimizes his desire to say ""fuck you, society.""  How many of those reveling fans can say they've lived a life as shitty as Arthur's?",6.0

Having watched the film, I can honestly say it wasn't that bad as a standalone article. It was well shot, well written, and well acted. Some folks seem to have a somewhat irrational hatred of Gaga, but I'm not one of them. The musical element was okay in moderation, giving insight into Arthur's psyche through the medium of theatre. That being said, it did feel a little overbearing at times, messing with the overall flow of the film on occasion. I found the message of the film and the ‘controversial’ ending interesting and engaging: Arthur fighting with himself inwardly, trying to repent for his past mistakes and move on with his life through the naïvity of believing Lee truly loved him for the man he was. This of course being a false assumption, and when he wrangled himself free of the persona of Joker, everyone he thought had come to love and appreciate him abandoned him at the drop of a hat, leaving Arthur feeling betrayed and alone. They only ever cared about Joker and his legend after all, not the man behind the facepaint.

Just through existing however, this film destroys the legacy of its predecessor. This is where my true criticism lies, and where Folie a Deux fails. The first film was almost perfect, and the ending was no exception, brilliantly concluding what was a rollercoaster of shock, awe and pity, whilst leaving the ultimate fate of Joker to the imagination. With the advent of the sequel however, this is all undone. Arthur didn't learn any of his lessons, and ended up almost exactly where he started, culminating in him meeting an ignominious end. The plot of the sequel is essentially that of the first one, but in reverse and without any of the flair along the way. This leaves one with the feeling of wondering what the point of it all was in the first place. But then again, I suppose that was the point; his tale was always meant to be a tragedy. Still, some things are best left alone.",6.0

TheJoker,"The first joker film had a good concept and empathy for its protagonist. It did that by showing explicitly how society fails those with mental illnesses that don’t have a safety net and don’t fit in. 

The second film is bad in concept to begin with. Unlike the first film which assumed the audience would empathise with his particular story, the second film addresses a completely made up issue, of people who uncritically emulate the joker’s actions,trying to draw a parallel to, again, a supposed issue where people who watched the joker uncritically thought of him and his antics as justified and then proceeded to emulate him etc. 
the problem being that this didn’t really happen. A bunch of twitter freaks made up this narrative before the first film even came out, trying to incite some kind of moral panic. “Oh no, the incells will see this and then then attack people.“ And none of it happened.

So the film addresses an issue that didn’t happen and has also taken a needlessly antagonistic approach towards its audience. It’s not that films cannot do that, but it needs to be done with a reasonable understanding of what is being adressd and why. When there is such a grand mismatch between the well informed audience with good intentions who are invested in the story of the first movie, and the creatives who convinced themselves that their audience consists entirely of their own made up boogeymen who didn’t “get“ the first movie, then you get joker 2. 

There’s to my mind no bigger failure than than this sequel. 

Complete lunatics behind the scenes. It’s a pathetic look and not worth watching for free. Last Todd Philips movie I will see and I will be keeping an eye out to avoid other films involving the producers and writers. 

The DC Comics movies were already not my coup of tee, but with this any interest is gone entirely. They could announce a live action adaptation of the dark knight returns with bale and cavil right now and I still wouldn’t even consider changing my mind.


If you don’t feel disillusioned by this, obviously it’s fine to keep doing whatever makes you happy, but joker 2 was not made for you or anyone. It was made with the intention of lecturing people who didn’t understand the first movie and took the wrong message from it. It means nothing to anyone else, and doesn’t even consider the actual audience of the first film. It’s boring even outside of the context of the first film.

It could feature some popular Batman characters as well and give each their own musical style, like I’m thinking Riddler could have either a showman or Elton John style, Magpie (who’s a kleptomaniac villain obsessed with anything shiny) could have either a tango, or Maria and The Diamonds style, Scarecrow could have a Billie Eilish style, and Harley Quinn could have an electro swing jazz or vaudeville style.

TheJoker,"I loved Joker and count it as one of the most important movies of all time. for what it's worth, here is my take on 'deux';
the first movie made a lot of $ and gained a big following, especially among certain young white males. a central message of the film was; 'kill the rich'.
the director stated that he was not happy with 'Joker's' reception, referring specifically to the cultural ramifications of the film. given the fact of the film's financial success, there was pressure from the studio to make a sequel.
the director spent almost two years in post-production.
television and film has been used a major means of propaganda since the invention of motion pictures.
imo, the director intentionally set out to make the sequel to Joker a confusing parody of the first film's emotional impact and social commentary in order to alienate the original movie's fan-base. 
I believe that although the studio's intention was not specifically to lose money on this project, that priority was given to hobbling the power of the message delivered in 'Joker'.",6.0
TheJoker,"The Joker: An Idea, Not Just a Person in Joker: Folie à Deux
In the world of comics, the Joker is often considered the ultimate adversary of the superhero Batman. However, behind this famous character, deeper questions emerge about the evolution of the Joker and the nature of his madness. Looking at recent cinematic interpretations, especially in Joker: Folie à Deux (2024) directed by Todd Phillips, an important question arises: Is the Joker as we know him today the one who invented the idea of the Joker, or was this identity refined by a more psychopathic individual?

Arthur Fleck, the character played by Joaquin Phoenix in the first film, is seen as the origin of the madness that defines the Joker. However, he is also a fragile, troubled character due to painful life experiences and deep inner pain. In this interpretation, Fleck is the precursor to a bigger idea — the idea of the Joker — but he does not embody it in its most dangerous form. Fleck is a broken man, and although his actions defy social norms, he remains psychologically and emotionally fragile. His version of the Joker is an explosion of pain and despair, sparking chaos, but it is not a complete embodiment of madness.

In contrast, the ""real"" Joker, as often portrayed in comics and other films, is a full-blown psychopath. This Joker is not driven solely by personal pain, but by a cold desire for destruction. He is a criminal genius, calculated and devoid of emotion. In this framework, he surpasses the raw idea of the Joker, transforming it into a symbol of chaos and destruction.

This concept offers an interesting dimension in the portrayal of the character: the Joker as an idea, a force of nature, rather than just an individual. In this context, the Joker is not confined to one person or one embodiment. It is madness that can be passed on and amplified, a mental illness that spreads and evolves, and each new incarnation of the Joker can become more dangerous than the previous one. Fleck, in this case, is the first carrier of this idea, but another psychopath, with the ability to manipulate and spread chaos with frozen precision, becomes the true Joker.

This interpretation adds a deeper and more complex layer to understanding the Joker's character, revealing that the Joker is not just a single individual, but an idea that can develop and divide, becoming more threatening with each new incarnation.",6.0
TheJoker,"I really liked the movie. In my opinion, it was not so much psychological as philosophical. It made you feel uncomfortable and made you think. Quite brutally (just like life), but accessiblely, it reminded us of the tragic face of reality that exists, which we sometimes see, and which we almost always do not want to remember.

(Admittedly, as a musician, I have a soft spot for musicals.  I know it’s not every one’s thing, but kudos for taking risks which is rarely done anymore).

But when real feelings begin to grow, what makes Fleck interesting to Lee fades away, resulting in him doubling down on the Joker Persona - killing her & becoming seriously dangerous. 

They tried to do that I guess, but Fleck is still the Fleck we met at the start of Part 1, not the end. So it all feels pointless & disjointed.",6.0

On top of that shes not a psychiatrist in this, but a rich girl who pretends to be crazy to get close to joker and that COULD have worked if she realizes shes in way over her head and got more than they bargained because its not a romantic film like they marketed it to be.

TheJoker,"What the hell is up with ALL these negative reviews and comments?

(SPOILERS) I just saw the movie yesterday and I loved it. Although it is a musical, it doesn't FEEL like a musical much akin to how the first movie doesn't feel like a ballet performance. The musical performance scenes do so well in the movie context to symbolize Arthur going off meds and slowly drifting into madness. Arthur Fleck could never be a ""Hannibal"" or anything like that. He could never be THE Joker that we know and love, and that actually makes both these movies so much more tragic. All the way throughout both these movies, the audience is hoping for a moment where Arthur can shine. A moment where he finally tells a ""Joker esque"" funny sadistic joke, or a moment where we realize that he actually has some type of hidden agenda, manipulating the shrink at Arkham in the first movie, or maybe ending up mounting a revolution teased there. But no, Arthur never gets one single moment like that, save for in his own head. In my opinion that is a masterful move. Arthur Fleck is in the end nothing more than a broken man, finding refuge in his shadow. 

The ending of this movie was in my opinion a real stroke of genius, and no matter how much I wanted to see Joaquin step into the real Jokers shoes, that was never the point. And I realized that by the last quarter of this movie. Seeing the real joker cutting into Arthurs stomach whilst maniacally laughing was the best ending I could have imagined. The shock and impact of that moment was something entirely different, but it makes so much sense for Arthurs character arc. Arthur never did anything on purpose, he only acted on emotions or trauma response. But he did create a symbol. That symbol being more than a man and something which will live on and come back to haunt Gotham once again at a later time after having died within Arthur himself.

A point I want to make here to end my rant is that Arthur is the exact opposite of what Joker is supposed to be. Arthur is not manipulative, cunning or even intelligent enough to become what the Joker is supposed to be, even with the help of his adapted persona. The insistense these movies ultimately made about The Joker being an idea rather than a man is so perfect to the ""character"". Arthur never did anything on purpose, only wanted to see the world burn, and that is exactly what he accomplished by CREATING The Joker.

That's it for my rant, it honestly seems like everyone just buys into the idea of this movie being horrible without giving it a real chance which is really sad.",6.0

For me in the first place remains Jack Nicholson for being the most comic accurate version of Joker and I really liked his take on the character and in the second place Heath Ledger.",6.0

TheJoker,"a little too much ""subversion of expectations"" for some I would say!

A movie doesnt need to be ""bad"" per se to be not liked by viewers! Think of the Movie Waterworld with Kevin Costner! that movie was a high Budget effort with arguably great Actors but it just couldnt reach Audiences with its theme!

The reason why so many are disappointed in the second Movie is one; they did not think there even was a need for a second movie and two; they feel alienated by the whole concept of the second Movie!

Introducing Harley Quinn, a Character conceived as a ""joke"" side Character for Joker like Robin for Batman, before there even is a Joker is questionable at best. Also, whats with the ""switch and bait""? why is Arthur Fleck suddenly not the Joker anymore? the first Movie ended with him getting comfortable in his role as a maniacal outcast, you could see in his face THE Joker finally shining through, so naturally a second Movie would portray his transition to the ""real"" Joker.

Im not saying the idea or the concept is bad but it certainly does not mean it will be accepted by the general viewership and nobody can force them to!

If you liked it, great for you! I am sure there will be others who will think like you and enjoy the movie! the question is, will that be enough?

P.S. deciding to make the movie a ""musical"" and introduce Lady Gaga as well gives the impression that they did it because of her or for her and not because it made sense in the general context of the movie. Not saying it is so but many will get this impression and that will not sit well with them.",6.0

TheJoker,"Legitimate take.

I did like it for why you disliked it, I guess: 

Taking the story of Arthur Fleck to its logical conclusion in a more realistically depicted, bleak and miserable Gotham City.

After the manic delusion will come a depressing disillusionment - at least if you are not gifted, rich and superpowered enough to turn into a supervillain or superhero.

That realist approach to Gotham City drew me to the first Joker, and I got more of it in Joker 2.

TheJoker,"First off, I didn’t care for the first installment as much as the majority of the movie going fraternity did.  Sorry….

But I believe that’s why so many have panned this movie.  I think it’s an emotional response to what they felt the first time around perhaps?

That being said, this is not the best movie in the world by a long chalk.  But for me, it was better than its predecessor.  It was a bit pointless, and really didn’t have the big pay off you would probably expect.  But if you remove the whole DC, comic book connection, and treat it as a stand alone on its own merits, it’s an ok watch.

As a musical it falls short, with numbers that feel very out of place and don’t land.  I understand what is trying to be projected through the medium of song, but a couple of the bigger numbers would’ve sufficed.

I think the 3 main actors were very very good.  Phoenix was immensely good as you come to expect, Gaga absolutely fine, and Brendan Gleason shone for me also.

It’s definitely not worse than Madam Web or Morbious as some are suggesting.  Watch it on the big screen to give it its best chance though.",6.0

Back in the day, studios were able to make same amount of money through the sell of DVDs/BRs as they were making in cinemas. NOW, because of e.g. Netflix they almost don't sell any disks at all. Studios are afraid to do any new projects because they can lose a lot of money. Known IPs are at least getting some people into the cinemas, on which they have to rely these days.
The additional reason is that they want to have IPs bringing viewers, instead the stars. You can't control the star, they can be arrested or die or become needy. IPs can outlast a lot and they will bring people in. Example would be Rings of power (unknown actors) or Game of thrones",6.0

TheJoker,"the set, camera and lightings are all beautifully executed. BUT, thats just what i felt after watching it: I hv no problem with muscials, in fact, i love musicals. Yet the songs chosen are not memorable enough and i believe only one of them is original. Usually when i saw a good muscial i would rush to buy the original soundtrack right after, I do not hv such feeling after watching joker2, at all. Gaga could sing but it felt like she couldnt act, Phoenix could act but it felt like he couldnt sing. Not that i think they did a bad job. they did okay,  just super mediocre when put together, and maybe those songs didnt add synergy to the performance. The way the songs performed were not melody driven, which was a miss. I couldnt hummm the melody that could be the theme of this movie. There's no theme, of that i m aware of. One would argue maybe songs in this movie are more lyrics driven, in this case, they are not original enough to tie the plots. Then the plot moved so slow, or the whole thing felt so blended, or i m just not that into romantic movies about love stories driven by non original lyrics. The scene where Fleck imagined he killed everyone in the court room was a delight, it felt on-point,  but it hardly made up for everything in the movie. I dont hv strong feeligns towards the ending, becuz at that point i already gave up on the plots,: listen, Fleck fired his lawyer, then we never hear from the lawyer again from her perspective. Fleck escaped after the explosion in the court room, and we are not so sure about the verdict and the aftermath. However these plots doesnt seem to matter at all... so i kind of gave up thinking about whats happening and just go with the flow, then the ending wouldnt bother me too much. Oh and the cartoon in the beigning of the movie? the animation felt poorly done, it felt like flash animation and nothing close to the Wanrer Bro.  classics i grew up with.

But nope i walked past a screening of it at the local theater and heard the scores from the hall way and instantly i knew it was bad ...,6.0

TheJoker,"The joker has many origin stories. As many stories as there are versions. That's one of the things that makes the Joker so fun as a villain. So as bad as this story may be, it is still correct for this version of the Joker.",6.0
TheJoker,"Its art, right!? So in that case you have to lower or even cancel your expectations. I get it, movies nowadays are not as good as they use to be. But still its an Artform, an expression of many artists involved in those projects. You can not critices the Mona Lisa for looking sad or not smiling. 
I know, maybe not th best comparison, but you get my point. Art can not be criticized. Let that sink information a moment. 

The first joker was GOOD imo. But also manipulative. Especially at the Talk Show Scene with De Niro. I think mostly everyone wanted the joker to kill that talk show host. Otherwise it would be disappointing and another point to criticize the movie ;)
I think most of the audience, of us, wanted to have this sensation again. With this expectations going into Joker 2 and any other sequel for that matter will be seen as a bad flick. Not the same sensation, not good.Thats how it works unfortunately.

BUT, for me, I like to watch sequels and how the author, director, actor and so on, thinks how the story could be going further and further and......
Its not my piece of art. I am not in the position to judge, just watch have my feelings and thoughts and than go home.

I simply can't understand why anyone would be given 200m to make a film especially when the first movie only cost 70m.

TheJoker,lol I loved this review and the elf bit was so spot on.,6.0
TheJoker,"This movie was meant to be trash, but I thought it was genius. In a Gotham without Batman, the Joker has to be dealt with by the justice system. I found it interesting how the trial paralleled real life trials like; Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Jefferey Dahmer, Richard Ramirez, etc. Richard Ramirez had groupies, who would show up to his trial and write him love letters, that was Harley Quinn's part. Mass shootings are often times a result of a mentally unstable person being let down by the legal system or going unchecked by their parents, school, etc and THE JOKER is one of those cases. Arthur felt invisible and with the cameras pointing at him, getting his own movie, and constantly being mentioned on TV and Radio, it made him feel like a star it made him feel seen, so he held on to that persona. Some killers get off on that, having their name out there is their only purpose. The court room scenes were very powerful, Arthur had to sit there and listen to all the trauma that he'd gone through and relive those moments, he chose to ignore it the most he could and doodle. He drew the Joker, proving that the lawyer was somewhat right. That persona was his coping mechanism. The music aspect only enhanced the story telling. Arthur was described as living in fantasy. We got to see what his everyday life was like. He'd make sense of his life through music. It did get overwhelming, but that's why that scene at the stair with Lee was so satisfying, Arthur said what the audience was thinking ""stop singing, just talk!"" Arthur was beat down and mentally abused, his mother despised him, the guards abused him,the first person to give him attention was only in love with his persona... I felt bad and almost wanted him to win. The whole trial made you rethink that. We were forced to sit there in the theater like a jury sits in a court room and be reminded that he killed 6 people. It's not that audiences shouldn't like the first Joker movie, it's Todd and Joaquin saying you shouldn't idolize the jokers of the world. Arthur had to lose, he had to be held accountable for his actions. That last scene is his punishment, the guy who stabs him signifies that there are multiple Jokers in this world. Just because Arthur dies doesn't mean the Joker dies. It makes me wonder, how many Jokers we are living amongst in our daily lives.",6.0

I've never bought that these hollywood movies take hundreds of millions of dollars to create, nor do I buy it for modern video games. It all just feels like a giant waste of money on a year(s) long orgy by everyone involved while they create a 50 million dollar blockbuster entertainment, in theory. Whether it becomes that is another story. I'm sure some of the CGI heavy films probably cost an arm and a leg if they were intended to be major flicks like LotR, Star Wars, etc. But when a show like disney star wars, or this for example is involved, I am laughing at your claim that it cost you 200 million+ to create your movie or star wars show when it's CGI use is next to non existent.",6.0

It’s sounds like this begins with certain people seeing him as a superstar, then over the course of the movie everyone realizes, meh, he is just an insignificant loser.",6.0
TheJoker,Well in fairness DC destroyed the Joker years ago. But then again DC is a dead property at this point. Which angers me greatly. That's what activism does to an IP.

TheJoker,"The 2019 movie was good, "" in my opinion"", 2nd place, of course, to Heath Ledgers Joker, but with this 💩 fling, it's obvious the 2019 one should have been a stand-alone movie with the Joker possibly making an escape at the end, after getting interviewed by a seemingly normal woman by the name of Harley, who becomes infatuated with him and his story, instead of talking again to the black psychiatrist from the start ""possibly"" and little Bruce Wayne standing over his dead parents.",6.0

It destroyed Joaquin Phonenix's Joker character. An (almost) self contained Joker version in an alternate Batman universe.

Lucky for me the Cinema let me change the ticket instead i saw last night The Substance which was really good better than i thought.

Do I admire them making this film? No mot really and not even because I disliked it.  

I don’t admire them because it’s clear that they knew what they were doing, they had to have had test screenings that told them what a mistake this was, but hubris told them to continue. 

This is Hollywood letting the mask slip.  Watch this film and realize this is what hollywood thinks of you.  Every actor, creative and producer thinks this is a movie that you should pay for but more importantly that this is what you deserve for your hard earned cash. And that they went on strike for half a year to defend their right to get paid more to make movies like this.

It’s true world building and sets the stage for a man becoming myth and in my opinion is work of art and is very nearly as good as the first.   I think if this film had come out first and wasn’t a sequel nearly all of its critics would be singing its praises, but people love the first film so much.

""joker"" was supposed to be a new start for film-making: more middle-priced films that do not need to make over a billion dollars, but can instead recoup their budget with a reasonable profit. instead, hollywood seems to want to carry on its death-spiral by throwing vast amounts of money on films, with no chance of even breaking even.",6.0
TheJoker,"""joker: folie à deux"" is now at $121 million. if they had spent $70 million dollars on it, it would be close to having recouped its budget, the film would be exactly the same, and film studios might think: ""we could make money from films that properly examine topics like mental illness"". hopefully, ""joker: folie à deux"" will keep going at the box office; it deserves to.",6.0
TheJoker," @bigcubistman  The problem is that, if it just breaks even, they're not going to see value in that.  They don't want movies to break even; they want them to be wildly profitable.",6.0
