Even before the movie was out, many critics thought it was going to be the flop that would send rdj packing and hitchhiking out of Hollywood indefinitely. Well three things happened that no one was prepared for: sequels, a multibillion dollar franchise, and a movie that shattered box office records that we will probably never see broken in our lifetime!

Someone opposes him, they build their own suit and try to kill him

A billionaire industrialist and genius inventor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is conducting weapons tests overseas, but terrorists kidnap him to force him to build a devastating weapon.

2 Samuel 14:17

5 All day they twist my words;

In anger cast down the peoples, O God!

Isaiah 24
New King James Version
Impending Judgment on the Earth
24 Behold, the Lord makes the earth empty and makes it waste,
Distorts its surface
And scatters abroad its inhabitants.
2 And it shall be:
As with the people, so with the priest;
As with the servant, so with his master;
As with the maid, so with her mistress;
As with the buyer, so with the seller;
As with the lender, so with the borrower;
As with the creditor, so with the debtor.
3 The land shall be entirely emptied and utterly plundered,
For the Lord has spoken this word.

4 The earth mourns and fades away,
The world languishes and fades away;
The haughty people of the earth languish.
5 The earth is also defiled under its inhabitants,
Because they have transgressed the laws,
Changed the ordinance,
Broken the everlasting covenant.
6 Therefore the curse has devoured the earth,
And those who dwell in it are desolate.
Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned,
And few men are left.

7 The new wine fails, the vine languishes,
All the merry-hearted sigh.

The noise of the jubilant ends,
The joy of the harp ceases.",1 year ago,@acts15ministry25,UCSU1-mMMUmvancd1es6U4fA,0,1,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_n4pEwngmvSYS9WqZ8j8FqjH6qaYrNV2AG-rTgtPU8xTw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,False,1702429781.46283

Even though he did a short disneycember review way back  in 2015
He says it's flawed but not majorly 
This is Robert Downey Jr's movie anchoring everything 
He wishes the last third was as big as the first third
Not one of the great comic book movies but it stands out enough

UgwF8dUiKEvIJcE0HJp4AaABAg,"I cant but help feeling for Terrence Howard who played James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in the first Iron Man film in 2008...

Why!

I can zee why "" If this was the 100% truth "" that even in 2008 Robert Downey Jnr was still having problems with drink & drugs substance abuse yet the very actor who supposedly vouched for Robert Downey Jnr & helped get him the role was in fact the actor they shafted for Iron Man 2 & 3

It was agreed that if Iron Man was successful in kicking off the Biggest catalogue of MCU Characters that launched quite a few characters their own 3 separate movies & no doubt a comic book movie fan could tell me tge exact amount of so many pictures that were made right up to Avengers End Game that Terrance Howard would play the same character in both Iron Man 2 & 3 but when he informed about the drop in Salary that was meant to be 10 million dollars was dropped to 40,000 dollars & i know money isn't everything but no one reading this & working hard in their day to day & night to night jobs would all walk out if they were told they were getting an 1/8th of the salary they were currently on...

But as much as Terrence Howard must have been so pissed off about the outcome he should have known , as thats Hollywood & in the Movie Business just like it was when the Music Industry was alive & doing well , it was & is expected  to get shafted even if theuve signed a legal binding contract as even already Big Budget Box Office Male & Female Actors that can make 100's of millions back for starring in specific films should always expect the worst possible outcome & when you've legally done everything you can to make sure your covered & it still happens then again you should be prepared for such events in what i state "" If you expect the Unexpected , then it becomes Predictable ""

If you were to know the amount of actors that were in the running for the lead male or female role it would be unumerable but it does help when you have been vouched for & according to Terrance he went out on a limb to back & vouch Robert Downey Jnr for the part of Iron Man but even if its in a contract the Movie Industry can always find a way out of sticking to said contracrs...

Even though i dont agree with what happened that wont stop a Big Budget Hollywood movie from being made & for Iron Man 2 choosing Don Cheadle was a smart move as like Terrence Howard (they & he) Don has a glowing reference of roles he has played but if its true i hope at somepoint Terrence Howard & Robert Downey Jr can see past this & according to what was written in an interview back at the time of the 2008 Iron Man film even Robert Downey Jnr admitted & also stated that Terrence Howard helped him get the part but one huge , no massive thing in the way is the fact that the amount of MCU films that were made in a 10 year period would have given Terrence Howard a nice salary but again lets get real as supporting actor withun these MCU movies will never receive as much as the main star & no doubt there were quite a few salary difference between all supporting actors & even the main lead role actor could se them get less & though Din Cheadle went on to star in most of those movies over 10 years i doubt even he was getting a huge salary as thats just how the business of Hollywood works & again like the Music Industry you need to have tough skin if you want to make a lifelong & a prosperous enough career in movies throughout your career as a Hollywood Actor...

On finishing i had to say i thought i saw it coming even though i thought they may try another actor to click their finger & thumb that brought 99% of all of those who were wiped out in Avengers Infinity War & the first was the combined Banner/Hulk but it was fitting that since the film Iron Man launched this incredible 10 year period of ongoing MCU films that it should see the character of Iron Man aka Tony Stark be the one to end it & i have to admit that this was the Biggest Box Office of MCU Films that likes of we may never see again & im sure both male & female viewers had their favourite character being played by a huge amount of actors & again one of the Biggest & Bold Moves that Hollywood ever took on but apart for the occasional specific actors getting either their first spin off movie purely based on their Charactor or another new film featuring a character that has already had 2 to 3 separate movies purely based on that character is about as much as we'll get as all those movies over a 10 year period wasnt enough that they have also written & they currently playing there Tv Shows now on Disney Plus but ive had about enough of comic book character movies & its time to move on what other movies are worth my time...

In light of this still ongoing coronavirus and its variants stay safe and healthy wherever you are in this world...

Любое УПОМИНАНИЕ в фильме О БОГЕ, ВСУЕ это обычное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО), самый СТРАШНЫЙ ГРЕХ если прельститься. НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам же ФИЛЬМ прежде всего НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества страшных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, таких как ЛУКАВСТВО, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ГОРДЫНЯ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ГНЕВ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, МЕСТЬ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ТЯГА К АЛКОГОЛЮ, КУРЕНИЕ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ДЕНЬГАМ), ЛЮБОСТЯЖАНИЕ. А ЭТО всё ГРЕХИ. И вот ТАК ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ, ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым собственным ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. А ПОЧЕМУ МАНИПУЛЯЦИЯ. «ПРИОРИТЕТНЫМ» демоном который завладевает душой человека после просмотра фильма, если конечно он уже не находится в душе, а если находится тогда усиливается бесом соответствующей порочной страсти, потому что он фактически из них и состоит, БУДЕТ ДЕМОН МУЧИТЕЛЬ МЕСТИ, ПОТОМУ ЧТО КАК реально примерно ВЫГЛЯДИТ ЭТОТ ДЕМОН в своём «демоническом» виде ПОКАЗАНО В этом ФИЛЬМЕ. ПОЭТОМУ при просмотре подобных фильмов ЗАЩИТА тоже существует. ЕСЛИ СОГРЕШИЛ (даже только в мыслях, в данном случае почувствовал проявление пороков записанных выше), надо сразу же ПРОИЗНОСИТЬ МОЛИТВУ ГОСПОДА нашего ИИСУСА ХРИСТА. «ГОСПОДИ ИИСУСЕ ХРИСТЕ СЫНЕ БОЖИЙ СПАСИ И ПОМИЛУЙ МЕНЯ ГРЕШНОГО». Стопроцентно помогает. А что касается сюжета самого фильма. Образно показана битва дьявола(образ железного человека) со своими же демонами мучителями восставшими против него возглавляемые демоном мучителем лукавства(образ в фильме его заместителя). А битва идёт за апокалипсис(полное уничтожение привычной земной жизни человека). НО ЭТО очень «глубокий» момент, и было бы хорошо чтобы каждый зритель понимал это. Но ПОНЯТЬ МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.

Да и ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ это ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ, ЛУКАВСТВО, СЕБЯЛЮБИЕ, ТРУСОСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ЖАДНОСТЬ, ОСУЖДЕНИЕ, АЛЧНОСТЬ, СКУПОСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ, ЛИЦЕМЕРИЕ, УНЫНИЕ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, РЕВНОСТЬ, ВОРОВСТВО, РАЗДРАЖЕНИЕ, ВЛАСТОЛЮБИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, ЛЮБОПЫТСТВО, ПЬЯНСТВО, КУРЕНИЕ, ПРЕЛЮБОДЕЯНИЕ, ОБИДЧИВОСТЬ, ЗАСТЕНЧИВОСТЬ, ХИТРОСТЬ, РАССЕЯННОСТЬ и т.д. и т.п. И у КАЖДОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА своя(СТРАСТЬ), так сказать, ЛИЧНАЯ. И ЭТО всё БОЛЕЗНИ(а почему мы все «больны», это тема для отдельной беседы), но БОЛЕЗНИ ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.

И ГЛАВНОЕ. ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.

Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет ""БОРОТЬСЯ"" СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕ ВИДИМОГО),через СЫНА БОГА СЛОВО(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА.
