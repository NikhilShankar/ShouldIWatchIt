Lucius was one of Rome's greatest emperors. He began as a senator (confirmed to the Senate by Emperor Marcus Aurelius). He was a general and a governor before becoming emperor. He was a warrior emperor, and died in Britain in 211CE waging military campaigns to subdue the Britons and Scots in what was then called Caledonia.He established the original boundary of Londinium (London). When emperor Commodus died (he's in the film), it was Lucius that became the next emperor!\n",

And surely you've heard about Hannibal crossing the Alps (with elephants) to attack Rome from the north? Finally, Rome used African soldiers in its legions, especially African cavalry as shock troops! It's too bad this history is still unknown to most Americans. Google: Lucius Septimius Severus to see an image from Roman times of him, his wife Empress Julia Domna (born in modern day Syria). It's NOT \"woke,\" it's untold history!

Nobody talks and sounds like Denzel in ancient times. Those are the exact r*cist stereotypes perpetrated by ignorant people and it’s absurd. He may look out of place to some, but no one spoke or acted like anyone we see in modern films during ancient times, regardless of the actor. That critique perpetuates stereotypes and reflects ignorance. Neither his narration nor his look embodies anything “gangster.” If someone wants to target Denzel, why not critique the entire cast? Ancient Rome was thousands of years ago, and no one in that production represents the actual historical people of the time. Latin was the dominant language, but many other languages were spoken as well. The English language didn’t even exist. The people were shorter and had very different physical features. Moreover, when historical shows or movies are made, they employ a significant amount of ARTISTIC LICENSE! So, I suggest you educate yourself because, frankly, anyone agreeing with such criticisms is either r*cist or lacking in critical thinking.\n",

You completely missed the sense of his comment. Imo another black actor or a less known one  would have been a better choice. Avoid giving lessons while u're not even able to understand the real sense of the comment, there is absolutely nothing r*cist in this comment, u made a mistake, everybody make mistakes, but u simply have to admit it ;), it's not a big deal dw. You may not agree with his opinion, coz it's a subjective question,  but stop seeing r*cism when there is none, a lot of ppl think as well that Denzel doesn't fit this role and absolutely not bcs he is black, so it's not a question of historical  ignorance neither... In this trailer he doesn't fit, perhaps the movie will prove us wrong, perfectly possible, no problem with it, but in this trailer he doesn't fit at all, I'm 100% agree, I'm not r*cist nor in lack of critical thinking ;), some actors fit better than others depending on their way to act, on the public image they have related to their previous roles, etc, whether you admit it or not, and obviously no one in the cast represents the actual historical ppl of the time, but they fit/looks for us (subjective ofc) more adapted, more credible, once again you simply made a mistake, that's all ;).

She/ he used the words “face and voice is to modern gangster.” What does that actually mean, if that isn’t a racial trope or slur? Moreover, I’ve heard this said about black people in the past and it makes my blood boil. I watched the clip, he didn’t sound anything like a gangster and he definitely wasn’t acting or speaking like one either. In fact, the more I read the comment I find it absurd and nonsensical. She/he also mentioned that he looked out of place as nobody talks or sounds like Denzel in ancient times. It’s a ridiculous comment to make. No, of course not as they mainly spoke Latin and the black guy would’ve been an African. As I’ve already stipulated, none of the cast sound or look like people who lived thousands of years ago, it’s called ARTISTIC LICENSE!\n",

He perhaps said it in a awkward way, I can understand it, but it was not referring to the fact he is black anyway , rather to his usual image, in his previous roles, and tbh I'm agree judging by the trailer anyway. Anyway I admire your fight against r*cism :), it was not the case here imo but it was a good intention of you anyway ;)\n",

Paul mescal vs Russel Crowe ... no way XD. Already not hyped at all by a gladiator 2, but yeah, little cast mistakes, and that will not help the movie I think.. compared to the first one ... who knows, a bad buzz stay a buzz lol, but it sounds badly gone for this movie.

Understanding of others prevent so many useless/avoidable clash most of times :D, but yeah sometimes a third party can be needed, useful, to temperate haha, u well summarized it :D.

Furthermore, I’m not speaking about one specific period; I’m speaking about the broader historical context. It frustrates me that people like “Triple”use words like “gangster” to describe Black people, which truly makes my blood boil. For over a century most of the historical movies, including documentaries have always used artistic license or manipulated the facts in favour of Western culture or audiences. Thank goodness such  r*cism and small mindedness is beginning to change.\n",
      " @mas33533  😂 surprisingly I partially agree with you because I’ve had to endure the outdated methods for decades. However if you gave me a choice, I would prefer actors that actually pass as indo Europeans and there are many out there. I’m definitely for historical accuracy🥰\n",

These traits are also to be found in Southern Italian and Greek populations.

      "We're likely in the period following Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, with the main character presented as the son of the gladiator Maximus. This places the story within the \"Severan Dynasty.\" Historically, it is entirely possible that the Roman Empire, particularly in Rome, had many African descendants in high-ranking positions. One of the five emperors of this turbulent time, Septimius Severus, was the son of an Italian woman and an African man, a knight from Leptis Magna in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Severus’ reign, there was a significant presence of Africans, Libyans, Syrians, and Black Africans. Therefore, it is quite plausible that someone of African descent could have held a position such as \"Ludi Magni\" (Games Organizer). I’m not at all surprised by this representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that there were indeed naval battles held in the Colosseum in Rome during that era, known as \"naumachiae.\" The Romans had invented a system with wooden floors that could be lifted. They would fill the arena with water and simulate large naval battles, which often ended in bloodbaths. Then, using pulleys, the wooden floor would be lowered, the water drained, and gladiatorial combat—either between the fighters or against wild beasts—would take place.  The big doubt, though, is how, as shown in the trailer, they could fill the Colosseum with sharks?  That seems quite improbable and has never been mentioned in historical records. Then again, the Romans were so ingenious, you never know with them.\n",

That's why often sequels can be rly a bad idea, concerning some movies anyway, mostly to masterpieces like gladiator.\n",

Although Rome continued for another two centuries, the betrayal, incest, corruption, murder, and greed for power was unmatched and began the decline of the empire. This I have got to see.\n",

Someone even said, \"2000: Gladiator, 2024: American Gladiator.\" Look, when it comes to cinema, American films have inspired the world, much like Japanese anime has. And let’s not forget, even a lot of Japanese anime was inspired by American movies in the first place.\n",

Third, Macrinus was not a black American but an Andaman islander admixed with an Eskimo. Fourth, the most popular entertainment of that time was the clash of gladiators with Godzilla.\n",

      "Referencing your \"woke\" comment about \"black Roman soldiers,\"  Rome had several Emperors from Africa. For example, Marcus Opelius Macrinus and Lucius Septimius Severus. Lucius was one of Rome's greatest emperors. He began as a senator (confirmed to the Senate by Emperor Marcus Aurelius). He was a general and a governor before becoming emperor. He was a warrior emperor, and died in Britain in 211CE waging military campaigns to subdue the Britons and Scots in what was then called Caledonia.He established the original boundary of Londinium (London). When emperor Commodus died (he's in the film), it was Lucius that became the next emperor!\n",

      " Also, Rome was almost destroyed during the Punic wars by Carthage, an African city state. A Carthaginian army killed an estimated 70,000 Romans at the Battle of Cannae, 216BCE. And surely you've heard about Hannibal crossing the Alps (with elephants) to attack Rome from the north? Finally, Rome used African soldiers in its legions, especially African cavalry as shock troops! It's too bad this history is still unknown to most Americans. Google: Lucius Septimius Severus to see an image from Roman times of him, his wife Empress Julia Domna (born in modern day Syria). It's NOT \"woke,\" it's untold history! So much of modern American politics is an illusion that has no basis in historical facts.\n",

Have been visited the southern region of Spain (Andalusia, or Al Andalusia in Arabic)? I have, and the Moors were brilliant (see Seville, Cordoba, Grenada). Read the Book of Sir Roland (circa 718CE), a Frankish warrior who fought against the Moors (Islamic \"Saracens\") in modern-day France. The Moors are described as“Blacker than ink with large noses and ears” and with “nothing white except the teeth.” (Moriaen. Arthurian Romance No. 4, PP. 29, 39, 41, 103. 1907. Trans. by J. L.

      "Well then I really like Denzel Washington but making him a Macrinus the leader of the Praetorians who will assassinate Caracalla is pure bullshit. Macrinus is from North Africa and at that time North Africa was populated by Berbers who had mostly dark skin and not black. Black people lived and live in sub-Saharan Africa. It happened that these Berbers crossed the Sahara in order to raid to capture black slaves and take them back to North Africa. Later the Arab-Berber Muslims continued these practices hence the presence today of black populations in the Maghreb. If Macrinus is not a descendant of an Italian who settled in North Africa during the Republican period it is very likely that he descends from local Romanized elites who at one time or another acquired citizenship. It is impossible that he descends from a black slave. Moreover, Roman society was very conservative, and the difference in skin color between a black person and a Roman whether he had light pale skin or light matte (Mediterranean) was too radically different to be accepted.\n",
      "As for the emperors Caracalla and Geta, they belonged to the Sèvres dynasty originating from Syria, again here it is appropriate to know if this dynasty descends from a family of Italian origin or from a family of Semitic Arab origin. In any case, their skin colors were certainly not light pale but rather matte. Here again we have the example of a cultural wokism that takes no account of historical truth or logic\n",

      "Africa is not a homogeneous continent. North Africa, populated by Mediterranean-type populations, is clearly cut off from black Africa by the largest desert in the world: the Sahara. We cannot therefore say that all of Africa is a black continent. As for the films you mention, the majority of them have not been watched by the general public for a long time. You have to have a little common sense, a little logic so that the public can immerse themselves in the story. We cannot therefore choose, for example, a white actor like in the 50s and 60s to play, for example, the king of an African tribe, or a Chinese or Japanese emperor, whatever the talent of the actor in question, and the reverse is also true. It is a question of maintaining a minimum of coherence, especially when it is a film that deals with a historical period. It is true that for this film the problem does not stop only with the character of Denzel Washington, there is clearly a casting problem whether with Pedro Pascal or Paul Pascal who have an oyster charisma, we are far from Russel Crow in addition Ridley Scott seems to have taken a lot of distance from historical reality (Gladiator had also taken some distance from history but despite all these \"liberties\" seemed credible and was counterbalanced by a powerful script rigor, which does not seem to be the case here). We are witnessing here an excessive Disneylandization, that is to say that nothing matters, we can do everything and its opposite without worrying about coherence and logic. We throw in special effects to excess. It is no longer cinema but a circus, a huge show machine without soul. You have to be devoid of culture and historical knowledge to find nothing wrong with it, maybe this film is aimed primarily at an American viewer.\n",

      "In ancient Greece, there was something called the Eleusinian Mysteries. While there's a lot behind them, the short and general of it is they were rituals where a person ingested a psychedelic substance called Kykeon. This is done before the person was then sent into a temple which was a kind of religious maze or labyrinth. It was set up in such a way that the themes and experiences inside the temple reflected the message of the ritual as a whole. You basically would go in, lose your mind on this psychedelic while traversing the ritual themed maze, then emerge as a completely reborn person.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Greek style statue that gets revealed when Hugh flips the switch at 1:18 makes me think they're leaning in that direction. The fact the room he's standing in is filled with religious symbols from different faiths (There's a menorah and a Shiva statue on the bookshelves to his right and left at 1:23) - The implication being he studies religion and probably dives into the mystical topics behind each one. Occultism takes inspiration from a lot of religions so the mixture implies something in that direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hugh modeled his house after this labyrinth style temple used during the Eleusinian Mysteries. The girls likely drank a tea or drink which was filled with the psychoactive substance (look at the table at 0:32) and he's about to send them on a journey that will change their lives. \n",

      "\"It will make your hearts beat faster. It may even make you want to die.\"\n",

      "He is sending them into this maze to reenact an ancient ritual which forces a person to overcome their fears and gives them a genuine religious experience. He purposely nudges them through the door which leads into the maze by challenging their faith. As religious people, they'll accept the challenge (which is what Hugh wants) while the door which said \"disbelief\" likely led them outside. \n",

Though, granted, that's something a lot of actors like him seem to sort of evolve into when they reach the age he is now.\n",

That one lie then calls everything else into question as well. Also possible she got weird vibes, or there were other tells, but we haven't seen the whole movie yet homie.\n",

She realises the candle is the real source of the smell of blueberry pie: therefore, no real pie smell = no pie = quite possibly no wife. It proves he's tricked them. He's lied to get them inside his home and that means they are no longer safe. Absolutely chilling.\n",
      " @leifhesse  they had been smelling the blueberry pie while they were there, so it put them at ease that there was a pie in the oven. Just as the man said there was.

      " @leifhesse It's because you're a critical thinker. It didn't click with me at first, as well. Just because a blueberry candle is burning doesn't necessarily mean a blueberry pie isn't in the oven, too.\n",

      " @leifhesse  The full scene probably goes like this: 1) He leaves to check on his homemade blueberry pie, an old family recipe... 2) He's gone for an uncomfortably long time, and the girls talk about how strange he's behaving and other little details... 3) One of the girls decides to leave, but the door is locked... 4) The other girl tries to comfort her friend, says I'm sure he'll be back with the pie any moment... 5) They turn the candle around and read the label. There is no pie. 6) This confirms their suspicions that something's very wrong.\n",

      " @leifhesse  i agree, wow it says blueberry pie creepy. the candle isnt lit so they cant smell the pie smell or is the candle that good you can smell it from that far.\n",
      "I feel like I’d definitely be able to tell the difference from a candle and a real pie, as would most other people. But I think it’ll have a deeper meaning once we watch the full movie, like something about trust and believing people without proof\n",

      "It took me a moment to get it but ironically enough she and I had the same face. She knew but I haven’t quite figured it out as fast. Chilling!\n",
      "That's my first thought too. Why the blood on the label?  And the writing on the bottom of the label was too small for me to read but what if that name is the name of his wife and he made her into a blueberry scented candle? That would mean that Hugh Grant told the technical truth when he told the girls that his wife was at home... It's just not in the way the girls thought. And by the time they realize it, it's too late and they're trapped.\n",

      "I thought the candle was going to have \"I <3 Satan\" written on it or something 😅\n",
      "It feels like the trailer missed the mark on how the whole pie thing was a big deal.  I mean if I was visiting some strangers house and he went to go check on the pie, and then I noticed a pie scented candle, Id just think the guy really likes pies.  My first instinct wouldnt be shock and horror.\n",
      " @FrawgfithAmblose  Oh there is no way. I would be 100% surprised if he were to bring out an actual pie.\n",
      " @patrickk1771  lol thanks for that. Now I feel better about their chances.\n",

      "Tbh the fact that there was no pie is the scariest most nefarious part\n",
      "But the candle isn't lite, so how would there be any scent?\n",
      " @FrawgfithAmblose  We don’t know what happened leading up to the part. Maybe he disappeared for an hour and then they realized something was up. Maybe they tried to leave and the door was locked then she sees the candle. I’m sure something goes wrong in order for her to panic after looking at the candle.\n",
      " @hieuluu2  maybe he has ten of them? Maybe they’re all lit in another room. You can deduce that if he owns this candle, he might have others. Maybe it was blown out right before she looks at it and that’s how she notices it. We haven’t seen the whole movie\n",
      " @gibons9892  In reality it doesn't work like that. The candle  was not lit, if there was a scent, it would be so faint  that you would actually have to sniff the candle for it. Also no candle pie scent smells  like the real aroma of pies actually baking in the oven.\n",
      "Why leave a tell in front of whoever he’s going to trap. This is not a omg moment. It would take a normal observant person to throw everything off. U could get the same effect with the candle in the other room.\n",

      "​@leifhesse he told them his wife was making a pie. When he goes to \"check\" on the pie, she noticed the burnt wick o. The candle and it says blueberry pie. He most likely blue out the candle before opening the door to make the scent of pie stronger\n",
      " @FrawgfithAmblose  its also possible that the black haired girl was already nervous and/or afraid, consciously or subconsciously, about being in a stranger’s home. Since she had not seen the wife yet, her mind probably went directly to the worst case scenario when she saw the candle.\n",

The smell was nothing but from a candle. Meaning he lied to lure them in his home. Where they already knew it wouldn't be safe if there is no women you might be in danger.  Now they know he a liar and they might be in danger\n",

I'm interested to find out\n",

The low effort of Paimon's Church (the tree house) just breeds realism to the fact that if a satanic cult (and Christian mythology) existed, the Church would look just like that. Not like irl satanic churches where it's all stylish and has the aesthetic of a metal band's album cover. Instead, Paimon's Church is just the treehouse, the dead bodies, a statue with Charlie's head, the bird in the cage and a picture of the Queen of Paimon. I will say it's hard to deny that the practical effect dead body of the grandma looked a little off (her arm was round-looking around the elbow).

Sister Paxton is blindly prepared to enter the house when prompted when Sister Barnes stops and recalls that they can’t enter without another woman present- i think this entertains Grant’s character a bit, and of course his wife just so happens to be home, regardless if there’s evidence or not- upon hearing that there is in fact the promise of another woman being present, Sister Paxton eagerly enters the house promptly, Barnes in tow, following in the footsteps of a wholehearted believer. however she is still hesitant. \n",

If you believe, fine, but keep digging. If you don’t believe, cool, but it’s also okay that others believe. And finally, women in religion are extremely easy prey for sick men.

Next, Equal, which is more post-modern normie dating nihilism mixture with Equilibrium. \"MUH FEELINGS! MUH PRECIOUS FEELINGS!\" Cringe. Next, I THINK Into the Forrest might be SOME social justice allegory involving gender politics. Don't know didn't see it, don't are too because 8/10 I bet I'm dead right. Next... OH $HIT, I take it back, THIS was the major turning point, Moonlight (should've have to explain).

And there's more here I don't know... Let's see... We Live in Time sounds like more relationship nihilism... Babygirl sounds like lesbian workplace sexual harassment double standard romance.

Then he slowed down in the mid 2000s, and has since been playing mostly supporting roles that are more interesting than his earlier leading ones. Even though he’s the lead in this instance, I have a feeling the entire budget for this film barely exceeds the 10 mil he used to get on a regular basis\n",

I get most of my critique practice by volunteering for the local film festival in town and screening films 8 months out of the year.

You can have stories of LDS losing their faith, but you can also have stories where people struggle but keep to their principles. I appreciate seeing that with characters of other faiths too, since it speaks to personal characteristics just as much as spiritual. And it’s the least goofy LDS movie aside from Richard Dutcher’s movies, which is saying a lot with how many LDS films are cornier than Iowa!\n",

With how Barbie was marketed up until near it's release, there was not ONE piece of marketing that hinted at the films broken and incorrect gender commentary. I honestly thought it was just gonna be a stupid live-action Barbie film. Like okay, cool whatever, how EVERYONE anti-woke first thought of the film. THEN as it got closer to release is when the \"Everything men do in your world, we do in ours\" trailers were being release and the \"She's everything, he's just Ken\" tagline was released and the final nail in the coffin for me was the internet with Greta and Robbie where Mattel walked by their comments it was a feminist film. I VIVIDLY remember the marketing of this film because it's the bane of my existence (metaphorically as a being in existence and literally as a man) and has actually made me hate the color pink a bit. Used to be like a top 5 color for me because I relate it to the cosmos or cosmic horror like Lovecraft's \"Color out of space.\" THAT'S the color I thought when I firs read the story, no joke. After Barbie, it's top 50 lol. \n",

If you believe yourself in the right to celebrate the misfortunes of others--even if a small portion of them have wronged you in some way--then I would suggest you take a step back and address your own misfortunes before you attempt to drag down the people around you in an attempt to give yourself the false sense of superiority that you seek.

The Wheeler's dad looked more like a stereotypical Mormon dad than that security guard guy who ditched Harrison Ford in The Fugitive when the train was coming did. And I even spotted a winged angel bust in the background at one point. \n",

      " @JustinZarian  Exactly, Suzie is a funny character and she works well with the rest of the gang. It's when they go to her house that my disbelief has to be suspended because all of the art is very traditional catholic and some of the mannerisms are strange even for 1980s Utah. The rowdy family is pretty spot on though in my experience. Not bad just a little uninformed on the directors part in my opinion.\n",

      "BRAVO to this!  This was amazing.  A24 rarely disappoints.  They are redefining the horror genre with films that make you think.  There is a time and a place for ax wielding maniacs, and then there is intellectual horror.  These A24 films are never as literal as their trailers.  This movie keeps you guessing and was very suspenseful. The first half is a little slow because you’re expecting it to be paced differently due to horror generally moves faster…BUT they are setting up the story and every detail and every piece of dialogue matters later.  This gets in your head and in a good way.  It challenges people to THINK.   The two lead actresses were amazing and I've never cared for Hugh Grant movies, but he is deliciously evil in this.  Very well written and highly recommended.\n",

Used to be you could just watch Disney's Pinocchio and wonder what a \"conscience\" was, what \"real\" was. Now, it's much more complicated. The brain is so complex, and I think this movie will heavily focus on that aspect of thinking.\n",

It does matter to me because I was a missionary and I currently have a niece serving a mission in another country, and I have a daughter who, at 8 years old, always tells me that she wants to go on a mission with the characters of those actresses in this film. I appreciate this film because it puts the global spotlight on the risk that our young missionary girls could or could not run.\n",

They were allowed to wear brighter colors at the very end of my mission in early 2013. This trailer sort of conveys how the more socially awkward mssionaries would come across. Id usually tell them \"we're representatives of Jesus Christ\" and try to start any conversation I could in a casual manner. I dare say I hated the initial street contacting as it was painful for me as a young man to get that kind of rejection.\n",

Maybe his wife is making blue berry pie in the kitchen and the candle is also blue berry smell . ( sorry my English is not good I apologize for Grammer mistakes) . I know in the movie he doesn't have a wife , but I just wanted to know how she concluded he is lying by only looking to the blue berry candle? Why she get scared when she looking to the candle\n",

If you have any knowledge of actual religion, I believe this will cause you to question some of the logic in your religious belief. This movie is meant for those not too strong in their knowledge, and for that it is amazing in its points. But if you are knowledgeable and able to answer this movies questions, it's gonna fall flat. Hugh Grant is amazing no matter what your beliefs are though.\n",

The literal candle is burning…use his trap to set the place on fire. There’s 2 of you and one of him…jump him. Why did they go in, in the first place, without insisting to see the wife first?

To anyone who is reading this, I do believe the church is true for the most part and high suggest inquiring about it unless you're LGBTQ. While they try to be kind to those outside of traditional families, they don't fully have a place for you within the church or after this life. They claim their stance is based on doctrine, but to me and many others it's a man made policy. There are a few man made policies, but other than those, the belief, values,  and community is wonderful.\n",

      "-I had an experience on my mission where we were teaching a man who said his wife was inside, luckily she was, she was an older woman that only spoke Lebanese and was in very poor health, so she had a hard time moving and did not meet us at the door. We had no reason to believe he was lying, and he wasn’t, I can’t even IMAGINE what these Sisters would have been thinking, knowing they unknowingly put themselves in such a terrible situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "But as a recently returned missionary I don’t know if I will be able to watch this movie as soon as it comes out. It is way too real. Missionaries see a lot of terrible things, and unfortunately many are put in danger, but luckily the church has implemented so many great trainings, resources, and procedures to do everything they can to insure the safety of their Missionaries and other members. \n",

      "so.... there is a pie .... right? i am a bit confused if there is one.\n",
      "What I love about the trailer is it's not even clear if Hugh Grant's character is actually \"evil\" in any way. He's potentially offering them a rite of passage to salvation and revelation. He's getting them to confront what \"real faith\" is, and offering them a way to \"temper it in the fire\". I'm all in.\n",
      "Not a bad movie but the trailer implying that the movir would be them exploring some kind of maze/labyrinth and that not being the movie AT ALL pissed me off and brought the movie down for me. Now that I know what it's doing i may like it more on a rewatch but as is I'm disappointed\n",

      "I don’ like horror, but at least I like Hugh Grant more now. Never liked to see him in his romcom movies.\n",
      "The antagonist mocks it but the movie itself challenges both sides. It’s basically like the South Park episode, “I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people.” I don’t know if you need to pay $15 to understand that though\n",

I know others love them and it's a safe way to be scared in this life and they can be real thought provoking things too. So I just let people enjoy them, am glad they are there for others to enjoy and I just ignore them.\n",
      "However,..\n",
      "I am a Hugh Grant fan. I have thought for years he was criminally underrated by critics and typecast and pigeonholed by the industry. In recent years, freed from being a romantic lead cause Hollywood is horribly ageist, he's had a much more fun variety of roles. Usually comedic but definitely different. Paddington 2 anyone?\n",
      "So I reckon I will break my long standing aversion to horror/chiller films of unpleasantness just to watch him be the bad guy in this. Great piece of casting from the looks of it, and I hope he's able to shine, and the film is good.\n",

But I’m definitely gonna watch this one.\n",

It’s not only a movie about movies but if you know something about movies you know this is a movie about movies about movies and has a lot of heart and still have SO much action. Im not even an huge action guy, but this movie had drama alongside all the amazing stunt coordination and effects. So glad I accidentally watched it.\n",

      " @peterlenham3180 i think this movie serves as like the first time Colt decided to do more than stunt work. When the show started he was already a seasoned bounty hunter, this feels  more like an origin story type of thing so that’s probably why it’s just Colt right now.\n",

      " @rambledogs2012 Yeah I'd already re-watched it and noticed the brown jeep. But ya don't get to see the front of it and I remember it being a darker brown and not 2 tone like the one he's driving. But it was like 40 years ago so it might have been 2 tone lol. 🤷‍♂😂\n",

      "This looks fun! Great that Lee Majors will be cameoing, would love to hear a version of 'The Unknown Stuntman' too...\n",

      " @robertshiell887  It's as close as it should be. Stuntmen of Lee Major's generation would've come up in their careers making Westerns, like Cliff Booth in Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. That movie was set in 1969, and that whole part of Hollywood was dying off. By 1980 nobody was making Westerns in any major way.\n",

It looks generic, flat and another time when Hollywood simply tries to cash in on an IP. Trailers can be misleading though and it is a good cast, so I'll keep my eye on it.\n",

      "Great movie, I love it! There's everything: love, action (great action indeed!), fun, moral teaching, and I just adore the soundtrack, my songs from the 80s revisited. I sang along all the time! Blunt and Gosling are supercool and the chemistry between them is strong, the director Leitch is simply a genius in the way he orchestrated all the scenes, which are supported by novel ideas in both the sequence and the effects and insight into the characters' personality. This movie is going to be my movie🧡\n",

      "Not gonna lie..... This looks amazing, and I say that as an original Fall Guys fan.\n",
      "For one moment i think it was an adaptation of the game.\n",
      "This movie contains a paradox. It's about a stunt guy, the stunt guy in the movie has his own stunt guy...\n",
      "This was the ONLY way to bring Colt Seavers into our era, and Ryan Gosling is the ONLY dude who can pull it off and make it look easy 👍👍👍 As screwed up as the world is right now, this is the movie we really needed  : )\n",
      "This movie is perfect. It’s everything a movie should be. A movie that transports you and takes you on a ride of a lifetime. It’s so incredibly fun, exhilarating, inspiring, funny, massive, touching, heartfelt, awe inspiring, loving, daring, extremely well written and performed and made. It’s a complete and utter blast. I smiled legit the entire movie. And so far seen it twice. It’s everything a movie should be. Absolutely perfect for the theater, I wanna seen it everyday till it leaves. It’s just so cool. So fun. I absolutely loved the film! Loved learning and seeing this side of movies. I want to be a stunt performer now! \n",

      "\n",
      "I’m so grateful for these guys, for everyone who made this movie, for stunt performers. Thank you for stunts. Thank you for this. Thank you for what you do. Thank you for in a small part doing it for us. I’m eternally grateful. And thank you for this movie. It’s absolute blast and new all time favorite. \n",

      "I’ll watch anything with Ryan Gosling in it at this point\n",
      "😮 awesome movie. Big shoutout to all the stuntmen out there who make our movies amazing 😍 without ever showing their faces. As for the movie itself, Ryan and Emily are amazing on screen and I just want them back...hell, make the fall guy a franchise now 😅❤\n",
      "No, but it is based off that TV show from the ‘80s.\n",
      "This is absolutely nothing like the series. Different concept and different character personalities. This isn't \"bringing Colt Seavers into our era\". It's using names from the past and slapping them onto an original concept.\n",
      "There's only one Colt Seavers, and that was played by Lee Majors. Modern film adaptations of many classic t.v series, seldom entertain.\n",

      "I'm 50 minutes into the movie and want to turn it off\n",
      "Looks fun and entertaining as it’s from the same guy who directed Bullet Train so it’ll be a crazy funny action film filled with laughs. Looking forward to it with Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt in it🔥\n",
      "This was honestly one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. Every single character, especially Blunt, was beyond annoying. Garbage acting, Garbage script, virtually no story, nothing made sense. Just a series of sarcastic quips and other movies references. Emily Blunt is without doubt one of the most self-righteous actresses out there, she’s terrible. Dire movie. Terrible.\n",
      "Movie theaters are hurting and in danger of closing.  This looks like what they need.  I hope it's as good as it looks and is a huge hit.\n",

      "Dun Dun Dun...Dun!!!!!!!\n",

      "Lord have mercy! Lee Majors is one of my favorite actors BAR NONE! Six Million Dollar Man changed the game for me. I watched The Fall Guy strictly for him being in it. I never heard Ryan's name in the movie and I had to Google and see if it was Colt Seavers and it is! AND they sprinkling in my favorite Bon Jovi song! I'ma 50 yr old Black guy born in Detroit raised in Alabama. Bon Jovi da 💩 Don't judge me 😁👍🏼\n",

      "Lee Majors was a Super hero BEFORE there were super heroes! GJ Blunt and Gos\n",
      "Watching the stunt crew kick butt at the end was awesome!!!\n",
      "After watching this trailer, I want to go back and re-watch the original TV series. I watched them as a kid, but never saw them in order, because as kids, we didn't get regular TV watching time on the old TV with broken rabbit ears\n",
      "Ryan Gosling probably had a stunt double for a movie where he plays a stunt double\n",
      "That thumbnail 😂 sitting on camera planning date and bad decision and all did it for me!\n",
      "I wish they would just leave the classics alone.  Lee Majors was a man. A tough guy who looked like a tough guy.. who looked like a stunt man/bounty hunter.  Ryan is babyface....and they removed the bounty hunter aspect from this character.\n",
      " @bossfan49  Every time the remake a show into a movie they kind of make it a parody. Generally 100% of the time I hate that but I'm going to give Ryan a chance strictly because I enjoyed him in that Netflix action movie. Lee Majors had me as a kid wanting all my limbs gone so I could be slow motion bionic! I would've been like ome of them armless legness Jerry Springer women that always cheated on their boyfriends 😁🤣🤣🤣\n",
      "Looks like the kinda movie a 16 year old school boy would watch happily.\n",
      "I like the part where he won the Ultimate Knockout and got the crown, perfect adaptation of Fall Guys.\n",
      "I'm picky nowadays on what I'll go to the theaters and see, and I've never seen the original show but this looks like a film I would see in the theaters. Looks like fun. On a side note I know Emily Blunt is English but is she purposely laying on the accent or is it original?\n",
      "Kinda feels like Hollywood stars making movies about themselves for themselves, not the general public.\n",
      "The fall guy was a bounty hunter, and is the black guy the new Howie?  And where the hell is the truck? I just hope it is better than the A-team fiasco, and the dukes of hazard. Is it just me, or does anyone else think the 80s should stay in the80s?\n",
      "did I just watch the whole movie in 3 minutes? ahahah\n",
      "They could have put Dua Lipa in this role instead of Emily Blunt and this movie would have been at least 10 times better…\n",
      "This looks amazing!! One of the best films uncoming in 2024!\n",
      "great movie! when I was a teenager I wanted to become a stunt! I deserve their job! The relationship between Colt and Jody is really romantic!\n",
      "Gosling used to be in intense and captivating movies like 'Place beyond the pines' and 'Drive'. Now he is in goofy limp twisted movies like this\n",
      "I thought I was the only one who remembered that \"The Fall Guy\" was an '80s action TV show starring Lee Majors. 😂\n",
      "Such a beautiful art of love put together and creativity. I say the stunt men should also be recognized for their incredible performance. You must love romantic movies. Is this your favorite?\n",

      "I think it is a good movie that has entered the cinema generation.  Those who love action and tension, go to the movies..\n",
      "Yep. I will definitely be buying this movie when it comes.out. It looks just hilarious.\n",
      "Damn, Ryan is so likable that I can't take my eyes off the screen every time he is shown. It's not just the way he looks but the way he speaks and acts, he brings life to the character.\n",

      "Ryan Gosling & he's driving, that's good enough for me, i guess i will see myself at the movie theater.\n",

      "This movie needs a stuntman to act to be a stuntman\n",
      "I'm so glad I didn't watch the trailer before I saw the movie!\n",
      "This movie was everything I hoped for and more, but if I saw the trailer in advance I think most jokes and stunts wouldn't have slapped as hard as they did.\n",
      "Looks like a fun movie. So bummed they didn't use any of the original theme song. That would have brought a bunch more of us older dudes to the theater.\n",

      "Okay, but....did Ryan do all these stunts? Or was it his stuntman? 🤨🧐\n",
      "Wow. Holy fuck that was a good movie. A no bullshit hollywood movie.\n",
      "Had to stop watching at 2:20, I sadly have seen too much of the movie already.  Why did they let us know that the guy is dead in the bathtub ?  Why is this trailer 3:21 ?  It doesn't need to be that long !\n",
      "Nice ,there must be another stunt double for this stunt double . 🗿👍\n",

      "Stuntmen, there was a montage at the end showing all the stunts and stuntmen.  It was a good action flick.\n",
      "It’s been delayed 2 months I was so excited for this 😢\n",
      "I wanna watch the final movie more than the actual movie itself lol.\n",

      "Emily Blunt level is going down 📉📉 I miss the days of Edge of Tomorrow, A Quiet Place, The Girl on the Train & Sicario\n",
      "I sure hope this is better than what Hollywood has put out the last 4 years. There have been less than five movies worth watching. Dune 1 & 2, Maverick Top Gun, Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning. The rest have been a waste of money and time.\n",
      "This movie failed.  I know they were going for the action with humor plus love story on the side.  It’s been done successfully many times, but in those movies, the characters took the danger seriously.  This movie messed up from the beginning when the first danger scene occurred.  The girl in the hotel was trying to kill him, and at the end of the fight, they were talking and carrying on as if the fight and her trying to kill him was a joke.  SMH\n",
      "this movie was so good I can't wait for part two\n",
      "SO MANY scenes from the final act of the movie in this trailer! Glad I saw the film before watching this. Sheesh.\n",
      "Not that universal reads these comments, but the fact that they deliberately deprived me of the opportunity to see Ryan Gosling ride a unicorn in theaters is dumb and dirty.\n",
      "It was very fun movie, people were laughing. Ryan Gosling hits the comedy strike after The Nice Guys.\n",
      "The stunts weren't crazy like Tom Cruise's ones but still I was happy to watch the chases and the fights which were really well done and combined with humor.\n",
      "Only Jackie Chan and Tom Cruise who literally can do this.\n",

They also heavily edited it to correspond to motions in the trailer, so attention was put into the use of the song, and its a good trailer visually, but by the end my mind is primed for an underwhelming cookie cutter experience with no heart.\n",
      "I just watched this movie. I know it's meant to appreciate the stuntmen. We can watch a documentary for that, but for a movie, it's not the same. It felt like the movie was aimed at a lowbrow audience. The storyline was missing. I wasted my time on this, just like I did watching \"The Nice Guys\" movie.

      "Sorry but the only thing I liked about the movie was hearing Kiss sing during the movie , the doberman biting the guys between the legs and seeing the greatest male performer during my life from Death Valley , 6 million dollar man , piranha movie and THE Fall Guy Show and others that HE did . Mr Lee Majors himself . It was great to see him again even though he was at the end of the movie and I'm guessing that must have been Heather Thomas besides him . I didn't wish to see the credits or the bloopers if there was any . Sorry Hollywood but two thumbs down  . If I was to turn this movie on again I would start it at the end with Lew Majors and skip the rest . The Pee Wee herman movie was better than this and I can't stand pee wee herman but in order to make my wife happy I watched the dumb thing . Ryan what's your name , please stick to the barbie doll movie everybody was talking about that you were in . I might give Ryan a chance if he decided to play Fred from Scooby Doo but sorry I DID NOT like this fall guy movie. Lee Majors , Heather Thomas , Douglas Barr and Markie Post ROCKS  !!! Also the woman who originally was the bails bonds person ( Jack ) . I can't remember how to spell her name so I won't butcher it\n",

Colt Seavers played by Lee Majors (of the 6 million dollar man fame and former husband of Farrah Fawcett.) I watched one trailer were a guy claimed that this was based on his life as a stuntman, like the creator of the original tv show didn't say the same thing in the 80s......Hollywood has no creativity the same slop recycled over and over.....\n",

Really tired film trying way too hard from the first frame. Gosling should hold out for better films than he appears in as he is a great actor who makes horrible money based career decisions. He needs a new agent and a new work ethic. Blunt was horrific, clumsy, forced and corny. I want my money back.\n",

Not sure if they can capture what the Fall Guy once was, looks like they changed it to be GenZ's version of what they think the Fall Guy should be.

There's lots of action, of course, but it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on in the movie, and the dialogue between actors makes absolutely no sense much of the time. Even with all the action, the audience was very quiet throughout the movie, and that's usually the best indicator that you've got a bomb of a movie. A total waste of money and a Friday night. 😐\n",

The whole film’s just about showing off the stunts from the beginning to the end and let all stuntmen shine cuz they deserve it. You can see how Ryan takes the main stuntmen with him to premieres and interviews as if they are his dates. Ryan’s making sure that the stuntmen get as much attention as he does🥹🥹❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥\n",

I think it's hard to get many chances, because usually when the film is a box office hit, they don't go back to deconstruct and possibly change it, or its part of a trilogy potential, so it's not meant to be a final say.   The closest I can think of, is from Pitch Black, having a Vin Diesel as Riddick being a loner trying to survive amongst monsters, to Chronicles of Riddick, expanding the universe with great visuals, and giving Riddick a brand new back story with Oedipus-like prophecy, with new non-monster enemies.   Both were great, IMO.\n",

      " @ericgarcia4745  That's why I don't have much sympathy for Gary, being somewhat pissed, the sequel seemed to go against the original.  Here's the thing.  The original, wasn't Joker, or certainly good comics Joker!   And it was a terrible message, for those who treated his type of murderous loser anarchy as righteous. So may be it's all well and good that Todd Phillips is correcting that erroneous impression, in a surprising way.    I'm not offended, because I rather disliked the first Joker movie.   And Gary's made fun of Disney elevating Cruella and other dislikable villains. Want a good Joker movie--watch the Dark Knight, or the animated \"Return of the Joker\".  Those are both amazing, and hardly a negative when Batman saves the day against his worst adversary.  I'm fine with that.\n",
      " @10secondsrule  Because it was not entertaining. It was grey, depressing, and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Batman comics. It was exploitation of an audience, bait and switch. If these movies were sold as movies about a sad, stupid bloke who is totally nuts and goes around killing people; if it was not \"Joker\" branded, then I wouldn't have complained.

Most people figured out it was a stand-alone character study with an unreliable narrator and enjoyed it for what it was.  No sequel was planned, there was no need to make a sequel, and using it to remove the ambiguities of the original was a stupid decision. And I actually like both Lady Gaga and musicals.\n",

      "\n",
      "-When Batman visits the jails where Arthur was held, flashbacks from the Jokers perspective play out (with questions as to who`s version was true like Rashamon, as various news reports with possible bias are also shown, further drawing some events into question leading up to Jokers escape as well as how it affected his state of mind afterwards).\n",

At times, you`re left wondering just who Arthur is now in his new identity (as he even has moments where he openly renounces the Joker only to easily give into temptation and slip right back in, feeling that society still has its effect on him and it's the only way to truly live with purpose).\n",
      "\n",
      "-The ending would have a riot take place in Gotham following the Jokers recapture and another escape and would end on a tall rooftop between him and Batman after a tense chase, with it basically being a homage to The Killing Jokes ending. The final shot would officially end with Batman leaving Jokers body on a cop car before leaving the now subdued chaos setting (as there was questionable moments where it looked like Batman may or may not have earlier broke his no killing rule had Joker been then and there, yet Arthur was also suicidal and looked like he could`ve jumped himself or consumed something fatal earlier, with the poison catching up to him hours later).\n",

      "2:29 WRONG.  This is a REALISTIC portrayal of Gotham.  Batman's Joker isn't going to appear fully formed out of the blue in a realistic Gotham.  The Joker is a VERY specific kind of crazy.  It makes far more sense that Batman's Joker is inspired by a proto-Joker.  When you add in the presence of Lee (Harley), it makes even more sense.  Lee was incredibly disappointed in Arthur.  When she finds out Arthur is dead, she is absolutely going to be interested in who killed him.  What do you think Lee is going to do?  Perhaps get hired as a psychiatrist at Arkham, and mold this young man?  IMO, the only realistic way to get Batman's Joker is to have him molded by Lee.  This new Joker would likely be everything she dreams of, which will cause her to overlook the eventual abuse.\n",

There's voiceovers like you had in David Lynch's Dune.  You can use obscure color palettes that most people won't catch onto. You can put insanely obscure objects in the background Stanley Kubrick-style.  Or you can take a page from the Golden Age of cinema and use song and dance.  It really does feel like the people bitching about the musical numbers are like children screaming that they got a Kobe ribeye steak instead of the hamburger they ordered.\n",

Did you wonder if Arthur's illnesses were things that exist in real life?  Probably not.  I've heard from so many people that what they expected was Joker and Harley rampaging across Gotham.  They probably thought \"folie à deux\" was just a hoity toity way of saying \"part 2\".  The animation before the film absolutely should have clued you into what to expect.\n",

Joker (2019) was entirely about society does to Arthur Fleck.  Joker: folie à deux IS ALSO entirely about what society does to Arthur Fleck.  This was NEVER about showing Batman's Joker.  It was entirely about showing what a shitshow Gotham is, which is absolutely a mirror of the real world.\n",

I believe it was removed after version III-R and replaced with \"shared psychotic disorder\".)  In psychology, a \"psychotic episode\" simply means a break from reality.  Hallucinations can absolutely be part of a psychotic episode.  There are times when Lee was certainly there.  There are times when she probably wasn't there.  There are times when Lee was there but what we see on the screen is Arthur's distorted perception of what actually happened.\n",

(Obviously I still have that to a certain degree.)  \n",

      "Like Arthur, I also experienced childhood abuse, and severe trauma as an adult.  I spent 24 years living at 100% the Federal Poverty Level.  I spent a decade living with my father who has failing health.  I was misdiagnosed with depression for 28 years, and my PTSD wasn't diagnosed for 30.  The VA kept feeding me MULTIPLE antidepressants for my bipolar depression, which ACTIVELY made the bipolar worse.  I have been an involuntary celibate for 27 years due to mental illness.  In the 2000's, I lost public mental health care because of budget cuts.

That being said, it did feel a little overbearing at times, messing with the overall flow of the film on occasion. I found the message of the film and the ‘controversial’ ending interesting and engaging: Arthur fighting with himself inwardly, trying to repent for his past mistakes and move on with his life through the naïvity of believing Lee truly loved him for the man he was. This of course being a false assumption, and when he wrangled himself free of the persona of Joker, everyone he thought had come to love and appreciate him abandoned him at the drop of a hat, leaving Arthur feeling betrayed and alone. They only ever cared about Joker and his legend after all, not the man behind the facepaint.\n",

The first film was almost perfect, and the ending was no exception, brilliantly concluding what was a rollercoaster of shock, awe and pity, whilst leaving the ultimate fate of Joker to the imagination. With the advent of the sequel however, this is all undone. Arthur didn't learn any of his lessons, and ended up almost exactly where he started, culminating in him meeting an ignominious end. The plot of the sequel is essentially that of the first one, but in reverse and without any of the flair along the way.

Unlike the first film which assumed the audience would empathise with his particular story, the second film addresses a completely made up issue, of people who uncritically emulate the joker’s actions,trying to draw a parallel to, again, a supposed issue where people who watched the joker uncritically thought of him and his antics as justified and then proceeded to emulate him etc. \n",
      "the problem being that this didn’t really happen. A bunch of twitter freaks made up this narrative before the first film even came out, trying to incite some kind of moral panic. “Oh no, the incells will see this and then then attack people.“ And none of it happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the film addresses an issue that didn’t happen and has also taken a needlessly antagonistic approach towards its audience. It’s not that films cannot do that, but it needs to be done with a reasonable understanding of what is being adressd and why. When there is such a grand mismatch between the well informed audience with good intentions who are invested in the story of the first movie, and the creatives who convinced themselves that their audience consists entirely of their own made up boogeymen who didn’t “get“ the first movie, then you get joker 2. \n",

Playing a “Joker” creates a Joker. You become part of a cycle of violence and unrest. And it’s not cool. You don’t go out a legend, or a hero. You’re forgotten on a cold floor. So. Don’t admire people like this. Don’t act like this. That’s why Phillips doesn’t even really show the new Joker. He doesn’t want to give the kid “a moment” or treat him as special or important. He’s not the heir but the conclusion.

In the past Neil Patrick Harris played him, imagine if we got a different stage actor to play him in a classic La La Land style film with a psychological thriller side. It could feature some popular Batman characters as well and give each their own musical style, like I’m thinking Riddler could have either a showman or Elton John style, Magpie (who’s a kleptomaniac villain obsessed with anything shiny) could have either a tango, or Maria and The Diamonds style, Scarecrow could have a Billie Eilish style, and Harley Quinn could have an electro swing jazz or vaudeville style. Music Meister could either have the music in his mind or make it his own powers forcing people to sing their inner thoughts like in the show Batman Brave and The Bold. If I was casting Music Meister, I’d choose broadway actor Aaron Tevitt.\n",

      "the first movie made a lot of $ and gained a big following, especially among certain young white males. a central message of the film was; 'kill the rich'.\n",
      "the director stated that he was not happy with 'Joker's' reception, referring specifically to the cultural ramifications of the film. given the fact of the film's financial success, there was pressure from the studio to make a sequel.\n",
      "the director spent almost two years in post-production.\n",
      "television and film has been used a major means of propaganda since the invention of motion pictures.\n",
      "imo, the director intentionally set out to make the sequel to Joker a confusing parody of the first film's emotional impact and social commentary in order to alienate the original movie's fan-base. \n",
      "I believe that although the studio's intention was not specifically to lose money on this project, that priority was given to hobbling the power of the message delivered in 'Joker'.\n",
      "The Joker: An Idea, Not Just a Person in Joker: Folie à Deux\n",
      "In the world of comics, the Joker is often considered the ultimate adversary of the superhero Batman. However, behind this famous character, deeper questions emerge about the evolution of the Joker and the nature of his madness. Looking at recent cinematic interpretations, especially in Joker: Folie à Deux (2024) directed by Todd Phillips, an important question arises: Is the Joker as we know him today the one who invented the idea of the Joker, or was this identity refined by a more psychopathic individual?\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur Fleck, the character played by Joaquin Phoenix in the first film, is seen as the origin of the madness that defines the Joker. However, he is also a fragile, troubled character due to painful life experiences and deep inner pain. In this interpretation, Fleck is the precursor to a bigger idea — the idea of the Joker — but he does not embody it in its most dangerous form. Fleck is a broken man, and although his actions defy social norms, he remains psychologically and emotionally fragile. His version of the Joker is an explosion of pain and despair, sparking chaos, but it is not a complete embodiment of madness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, the \"real\" Joker, as often portrayed in comics and other films, is a full-blown psychopath. This Joker is not driven solely by personal pain, but by a cold desire for destruction. He is a criminal genius, calculated and devoid of emotion. In this framework, he surpasses the raw idea of the Joker, transforming it into a symbol of chaos and destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "This concept offers an interesting dimension in the portrayal of the character: the Joker as an idea, a force of nature, rather than just an individual. In this context, the Joker is not confined to one person or one embodiment. It is madness that can be passed on and amplified, a mental illness that spreads and evolves, and each new incarnation of the Joker can become more dangerous than the previous one. Fleck, in this case, is the first carrier of this idea, but another psychopath, with the ability to manipulate and spread chaos with frozen precision, becomes the true Joker.\n",
      "\n",
      "This interpretation adds a deeper and more complex layer to understanding the Joker's character, revealing that the Joker is not just a single individual, but an idea that can develop and divide, becoming more threatening with each new incarnation.\n",
      "I really liked the movie. In my opinion, it was not so much psychological as philosophical. It made you feel uncomfortable and made you think. Quite brutally (just like life), but accessiblely, it reminded us of the tragic face of reality that exists, which we sometimes see, and which we almost always do not want to remember. The music, although sometimes prolonged, worked, in my opinion it increased the closeness to the characters, set the mood, made it easier to get into the characters' heads and read not only their behavior, but also their emotions.\n",
      "It breaks my heart that they did this to Joaquin's Joker, the first film was perfect\n",
      "What the heck were they thinking?  Absolutely ZERO Joker fans wanted a Joker musical.  Silly.\n",
      "While I’ve often agreed with your perspectives, I’m going respectfully differ with you on this one.  I really enjoyed this film.  While I became a tad bored with the setting taking place almost completely in Arkham and the courtroom, the musical aspect was well done and believable enough within the context of the film.  (Admittedly, as a musician, I have a soft spot for musicals.  I know it’s not every one’s thing, but kudos for taking risks which is rarely done anymore).  But the highlight of the film was Lady Gaga, who is arguably the best Harley Quinn since “Batman: The Animated Series.”   I had a great time.\n",

And in the end, his mortality literally comes to show. But… they could’ve told this story in a far better way, and I believe it didn’t even have to include Lee and it being a musical. It was a good story, but a horribly boring movie to me.\n",

Kinda like how in D&W the TVA treat the Logan film as the gospel, harley could be following joker and she could have not been manipulative but rather putting the pieces together “hey…maybe im not really in love” and feeling trapped and forcing herself to be with the Joker and hes the joker we all expect him to be because Arthur was already and hes gone fully embracing who he has become but making him a coward who feels bad for what he did and trying to impress Harley feels like so many other films where the Male lead falls for a girl who didn’t really love him, Harley being excited to be with him and going crazy and eventually feeling guilty or scared to leave and gaslighting herself to be his ideal dream girl would have been something the BTAS had where she was first introduced \n",
      "On top of that shes not a psychiatrist in this, but a rich girl who pretends to be crazy to get close to joker and that COULD have worked if she realizes shes in way over her head and got more than they bargained because its not a romantic film like they marketed it to be.

It was one of the best performances I ever saw; never saw an actor put himself that far into any portrayal.  He's an incredible actor and who are any of you to talk smack about him?  How many movies have you starred in?  None.  Just shut up.  You don't know what you're talking about.\n",

That's why it's a rip off of the first film and goes to show that majority of audiences zone out on story telling more than ever.\n",

      "While it's not the direction I would have taken I think it could have been good if there were less musical numbers, if they changed it so he was only faking multiple personalities for the court (or had more of a build up to changing his mind about being the joker), and if there was more of a build up to the climax because it just kind of felt random. Yeah that's my biggest complaint really, it lacked building tension.\n",

      "(SPOILERS) I just saw the movie yesterday and I loved it. Although it is a musical, it doesn't FEEL like a musical much akin to how the first movie doesn't feel like a ballet performance. The musical performance scenes do so well in the movie context to symbolize Arthur going off meds and slowly drifting into madness. Arthur Fleck could never be a \"Hannibal\" or anything like that. He could never be THE Joker that we know and love, and that actually makes both these movies so much more tragic. All the way throughout both these movies, the audience is hoping for a moment where Arthur can shine. A moment where he finally tells a \"Joker esque\" funny sadistic joke, or a moment where we realize that he actually has some type of hidden agenda, manipulating the shrink at Arkham in the first movie, or maybe ending up mounting a revolution teased there. But no, Arthur never gets one single moment like that, save for in his own head. In my opinion that is a masterful move. Arthur Fleck is in the end nothing more than a broken man, finding refuge in his shadow. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ending of this movie was in my opinion a real stroke of genius, and no matter how much I wanted to see Joaquin step into the real Jokers shoes, that was never the point. And I realized that by the last quarter of this movie. Seeing the real joker cutting into Arthurs stomach whilst maniacally laughing was the best ending I could have imagined. The shock and impact of that moment was something entirely different, but it makes so much sense for Arthurs character arc. Arthur never did anything on purpose, he only acted on emotions or trauma response. But he did create a symbol. That symbol being more than a man and something which will live on and come back to haunt Gotham once again at a later time after having died within Arthur himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "A point I want to make here to end my rant is that Arthur is the exact opposite of what Joker is supposed to be. Arthur is not manipulative, cunning or even intelligent enough to become what the Joker is supposed to be, even with the help of his adapted persona. The insistense these movies ultimately made about The Joker being an idea rather than a man is so perfect to the \"character\". Arthur never did anything on purpose, only wanted to see the world burn, and that is exactly what he accomplished by CREATING The Joker.\n",

The Harley Quinn backstory not being accurate to the comic version actually downgrades this version of Joker because in this movie Harley is already crazy, plus she is the one manipulating this Joker. For me in the first place remains Jack Nicholson for being the most comic accurate version of Joker and I really liked his take on the character and in the second place Heath Ledger.\n",

      "People resonated with the first film cuz most people saw themselves in Joker’s shoes as loners who get walked over by the world to a point of frustration where they feel like commiting acts of violence. They felt represented and now this movie was a slap in their face, like wiping their faces in the mud like “lol take that you loser” well congratulations. Now all those dangerous incels feel even more disrespected than before. Now the acts of violence are much more of a risk\n",

      "Joker was a decent movie if they wouldn’t have tried the Batman universe tie in. They should have called it “Carnival” and avoided the dc ties.

Brilliant ending. Brilliant orchestral and direction. Go see this film if you're looking for something other than the normal shit that is being released.\n",

I was disappointed in it not being a movie true to the character and it was like a 180 on the story line from the first.  It was a lost opportunity for WB and a waste of great talent and it will be most appealing to non-Batman fans.   It was good but I felt it was a bait and switch.\n",

Yet the songs chosen are not memorable enough and i believe only one of them is original. Usually when i saw a good muscial i would rush to buy the original soundtrack right after, I do not hv such feeling after watching joker2, at all. Gaga could sing but it felt like she couldnt act, Phoenix could act but it felt like he couldnt sing. Not that i think they did a bad job. they did okay,  just super mediocre when put together, and maybe those songs didnt add synergy to the performance. The way the songs performed were not melody driven, which was a miss. I couldnt hummm the melody that could be the theme of this movie. There's no theme, of that i m aware of. One would argue maybe songs in this movie are more lyrics driven, in this case, they are not original enough to tie the plots. Then the plot moved so slow, or the whole thing felt so blended, or i m just not that into romantic movies about love stories driven by non original lyrics. The scene where Fleck imagined he killed everyone in the court room was a delight, it felt on-point,  but it hardly made up for everything in the movie. I dont hv strong feeligns towards the ending, becuz at that point i already gave up on the plots,: listen, Fleck fired his lawyer, then we never hear from the lawyer again from her perspective. Fleck escaped after the explosion in the court room, and we are not so sure about the verdict and the aftermath. However these plots doesnt seem to matter at all... so i kind of gave up thinking about whats happening and just go with the flow, then the ending wouldnt bother me too much. Oh and the cartoon in the beigning of the movie? the animation felt poorly done, it felt like flash animation and nothing close to the Wanrer Bro.  classics i grew up with. The movie as a whole felt like an ok beautiful mediocre piece that didnt tell much of a story, a musical that doesnt felt like there's a theme.\n",

Maybe it would be like charly and the CF where the scenes blended in and you didn't really notice it was a musical . But nope i walked past a screening of it at the local theater and heard the scores from the hall way and instantly i knew it was bad ...\n",

They could have made another billion had they done it right so I don't think the \"they shouldn't have made it at all\" argument holds water.  No one wanted the first Joker but it happened and it was great.\n",

By about the 4th or 5th full length song, I was starting to have PTSD, finding myself terrified that every lull was about to become another terrible song and dance routine.

      "First I saw critics scores and I thought they hate everything fans love.  Then I listened to Grace Randolph and I thought she tends to skew very liberal, so maybe this is just a more conservative message, and now Nerdrotic.  I can’t claim he leans liberal.  So in this tense election season, at least we have one clear moment of bi-partisanship: everyone hates Joker 2.  It stinks.  I was looking forward to it, but I do listen to reviews: Jahns, Campea and Critical Drinker have all also chimed in with thumbs down.  When Nerdrotic said Gaga was underused, I realized all hope was lost.\n",

      "lol I loved this review and the elf bit was so spot on.\n",
      "This movie was meant to be trash, but I thought it was genius. In a Gotham without Batman, the Joker has to be dealt with by the justice system. I found it interesting how the trial paralleled real life trials like; Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Jefferey Dahmer, Richard Ramirez, etc. Richard Ramirez had groupies, who would show up to his trial and write him love letters, that was Harley Quinn's part. Mass shootings are often times a result of a mentally unstable person being let down by the legal system or going unchecked by their parents, school, etc and THE JOKER is one of those cases. Arthur felt invisible and with the cameras pointing at him, getting his own movie, and constantly being mentioned on TV and Radio, it made him feel like a star it made him feel seen, so he held on to that persona. Some killers get off on that, having their name out there is their only purpose. The court room scenes were very powerful, Arthur had to sit there and listen to all the trauma that he'd gone through and relive those moments, he chose to ignore it the most he could and doodle. He drew the Joker, proving that the lawyer was somewhat right. That persona was his coping mechanism. The music aspect only enhanced the story telling. Arthur was described as living in fantasy. We got to see what his everyday life was like. He'd make sense of his life through music. It did get overwhelming, but that's why that scene at the stair with Lee was so satisfying, Arthur said what the audience was thinking \"stop singing, just talk!\" Arthur was beat down and mentally abused, his mother despised him, the guards abused him,the first person to give him attention was only in love with his persona... I felt bad and almost wanted him to win. The whole trial made you rethink that. We were forced to sit there in the theater like a jury sits in a court room and be reminded that he killed 6 people. It's not that audiences shouldn't like the first Joker movie, it's Todd and Joaquin saying you shouldn't idolize the jokers of the world. Arthur had to lose, he had to be held accountable for his actions. That last scene is his punishment, the guy who stabs him signifies that there are multiple Jokers in this world. Just because Arthur dies doesn't mean the Joker dies. It makes me wonder, how many Jokers we are living amongst in our daily lives.\n",
      "The whole movie was a Joke.... At least this version of Joker is over and done with....\n",
      "Smh... How does something like this get made?? This was Matrix Resurrections all over again\n",
      "Am I really the only one who hated the 1st one? And then he makes part 3 a musical with a name nobody knows how to say...with Lady Gaga?! Nah, I'll pass.\n",
      "I really liked The Joker, but not enough to go watch a musical.\n",
      "Not one good scene in the commercials.  Because the movie sucks with not one good clip to draw in consumers.  \n",
      "Terrible\n",
      "Nerdrotic is way too soft on this movie. Bro didn’t even mention all the humiliation rituals they put Joker through and all the obvious propaganda.\n",
      "Yay let's give money to the guy who said he doesn't want to make a joker movie and if he does he's going to make it bomb. And screw the wile E coyote movie in the Batgirl movie cuz whatever\n",

      "Someone literally fell asleep behind me when i saw this 🤦‍♂️ I could hear her snoring\n",
      "This movie was incredibly bad like most of today's films. Hollywood is becoming a joke with all the politics that's leaking in it and in this movie they also wanted to enlarge the female and reduce the main male character. Absolutely pathetic\n",
      "I don't understand what was the point of destroying the character like that?\n",
      "\n",
      "They could've worked towards the same ending with a Arthur falling upward by inspiring people to commit crimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway a shitshow of a movie.\n",
      "Just curious, why do you intentionally mispronounce Lady Gaga every time?\n",
      "Hopefully they lost money. They keep releasing turds expecting something magical to happen at the box office.\n",
      "At this point I'm convinced about 50 million dollars is spent on a movie, and the other 150+ million is wasted away so badly that it makes the U.S. government envious. I've never bought that these hollywood movies take hundreds of millions of dollars to create, nor do I buy it for modern video games. It all just feels like a giant waste of money on a year(s) long orgy by everyone involved while they create a 50 million dollar blockbuster entertainment, in theory. Whether it becomes that is another story. I'm sure some of the CGI heavy films probably cost an arm and a leg if they were intended to be major flicks like LotR, Star Wars, etc. But when a show like disney star wars, or this for example is involved, I am laughing at your claim that it cost you 200 million+ to create your movie or star wars show when it's CGI use is next to non existent.\n",
      "Thank you, I was looking forward to see this because I loved the first movie. Now I'm not going to see it in the cinema, maybe I will stream it at home, or maybe I'll skip it all together.\n",
      "I haven’t watched it, I haven’t watched reviews that reveal a lot of the plot. But yeah, it seems like the first movie follows Fleck from being an insignificant loser, through his breaking point, to his rise as the face of a rebellion of the downtrodden public, at least in his own mind. It’s sounds like this begins with certain people seeing him as a superstar, then over the course of the movie everyone realizes, meh, he is just an insignificant loser.\n",
      "Well in fairness DC destroyed the Joker years ago. But then again DC is a dead property at this point. Which angers me greatly. That's what activism does to an IP. That said that first movie was decent. Though I re-watched it a couple months ago and realized it wasn't as good a few watches later. He becomes more whiny as time goes on.\n",
      "I pretty much knew this would be a bad movie when I heard Lady GAGA was Harley Quinn and it was a musical. …🙄oh well I ok guess I’ll watch it for free wen the torrent is out \n",

      "I thought \"it is a musical\" was an exaggeration. Nope 100% a musical and it is awful. Absolute garbage\n",
      "Looks like I'm not going to watch that it sucks bc I really enjoy the first one bc it takes me back to a great time in my life.

Lucky for me the Cinema let me change the ticket instead i saw last night The Substance which was really good better than i thought. Still what you've said reminds me of Netflix's Barbarians the first season was good but the second flopped. I will not entertain joker two. I hope film producers listen to channels like yours. 😊\n",

It’s true world building and sets the stage for a man becoming myth and in my opinion is work of art and is very nearly as good as the first.

If you're actually capable of free thought and can think for yourself ,you'll get it .. if not you won't people completely missed the point of this film and the second and calling it a safe sequel is an outright lie . The films are about  Arthur fleck and the joker is just a by-product . It's embarrassing to see this type of cancel culture because people don't understand. Sad world  we live in is even sadder than Arthur fleck's .\n",
      "Funny how uncultured Gary is. Joker wasn't an origin movie, it was a clone of a better movie from ages past for a new generation of manbabies who can't spare the attention span if there's not spandex in their movie. And Joker 2 isn't bad because it's a musical, it's bad because Todd had nothing to copy this time.\n",
      "In a perfect world, we got a heath Ledger joker solo film...\n",
      "I like the last Jedi for one reason. Because George Lucas should’ve never sold the franchise.\n",
      "No offense, but you are not a cineaste, let alone an artist, but just a man child „content creator“ with his toys in the background. What an incredible set of movies, they will age so incredibly well with time.\n",
      "A lot of times you get what you don't want in life. Deal with it. I liked it myself.\n",
      "Honestly all the negative press makes me want to watch it more.\n",
      "I think it was great, if you stop acting so entitled and accepted what the story tries to say, you'll have a good time. The problem is that people glorifies the Joker as a character, just like the people in the movie. Which is funny.\n",
      "Fact: Nerdrotic had a drug problem. Despite being mentally challenged from drug abuse, he an tell this movie sucked.\n",
      "The joker 2 was a fucken great movie if you have the brains to understand what both movies are really about which is mental illness \n",
      "This is a story about mental illness but batman themed\n",
      "It shows the reality of what would really happen to a real life joker and harley quin, they wouldnt get very far or start a great revolution\n",
      "This series is about the human psyche\n",
      "Who's prettier and a better actress than Margot Robbie?  I know - Lady Gaga.\n",
      "\n",
      "Said no one ever.  Except that one lady at Warner Bros.\n",
      "Joker 2 absolutley did not destroy the first Joker! The whole damn movie is a fucking disaster from start to finish. Todd had a chance to make a movie maybe even better than the first Joker but no.\n",
      "I liked Joker and I liked Joker 2.  Joker 2 wasn't as good as the first one, and probably wasnt necessary.  But I think you are reaching.  You're trying too hard to be the edgy contrarian\n",
      "Its was a good movie. That ending. Why Arthur cant be the. because the rule in dc Joker must always have a Batman otherwise watch the movie. Just pullout your Phones when u hear singing.😂\n",
      "Guys don’t fall for this BS review. I hate musicals too but the actual musical scenes aren’t whimsical and giddy as you’d expect from a typical musical. The movie was still good. Shot well. Great music actually. Except for one Gaga track and the ending was pretty good. If you’re a music buff and you liked the original sound track it’s still there too!\n",
      "Joker 2, is not a movie, is a very very bad joke. What a deception. The Joker was gold, they had to destroy it.\n",
      "These movies are amazing bad reviews on a movie that is sometimes good these movies are before there time they will appreciated as master peaces later that movie or remake will never do again and can never copy hope there gutsy enough to do a third that everyone is gonna want i ben 30 years when it's to late for sequels\n",
      "Why are you trying so hard to ruin an oopening on the first week???? Huh?  I wonder.\n",
      "This wasn't just a bad movie, this was a betrayal of the Joker character.\n",
      "both \"joker\" and \"joker: folie à deux\" deal with the subject of mental illness. if you have experienced mental illness, or how society and mental illness interact, you might have a different opinion to the films than people who have not been affected. they are not really comic book films. having said that, i would like the films to be linked into the new \"the batman\" series; it would be interesting.\n",
      "i am really angry about \"joker: folie à deux\" costing so much. it should have cost less than \"joker\"! it is not a blockbuster, and it should not be expected to make so much money. studios will be less inclined to make great films like \"joker: folie à deux\". \"joker\" was supposed to be a new start for film-making: more middle-priced films that do not need to make over a billion dollars, but can instead recoup their budget with a reasonable profit. instead, hollywood seems to want to carry on its death-spiral by throwing vast amounts of money on films, with no chance of even breaking even.\n",
      "\"joker: folie à deux\" is now at $121 million. if they had spent $70 million dollars on it, it would be close to having recouped its budget, the film would be exactly the same, and film studios might think: \"we could make money from films that properly examine topics like mental illness\". hopefully, \"joker: folie à deux\" will keep going at the box office; it deserves to.\n",
      " @bigcubistman  The problem is that, if it just breaks even, they're not going to see value in that.  They don't want movies to break even; they want them to be wildly profitable.\n",
      "Hahahah calling out msm for their dumbass takes is chefs kiss while making this video.\n",
      "The two young inmates are in Arthur’s head. If you didn’t catch that then maybe movie reviews aren’t your thing.\n",
      "Before you starts: is it according to source materialls and why you wrong?\n",

      "thumbnail and title tells me everything😔\n",
      "I feel bad because I don’t want to discourage major studios from taking risks like Joker 2 does. But there needs to be a balance between risk and groundedness\n",
      "If I had a nickel for every time Todd Phillips made a beloved movie and followed it up with a disappointing sequel, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.\n",
      "Basically, this film is causing literal mixed feelings... which proved why many of us predicted a sequel was not necessary.\n",
      "This sequel broke my heart. Everything that was so magically captivating with the tone and character arc in the first one were diminished into atoms. This shouldn't have been made\n",
      "Gaga released an album of covers called Harlequin because she felt like she haven't had enough of that character yet. Then, a couple of days later, everyone's saying the movie didn't get into her character as much as it should. It seems like she recognized this flaw even before the movie came out.\n",
      "This movie was pure trash. I stole it and still felt I was ripped off. My god it was bad.\n",
      "Thank God Todd Phillips didn't take the job as DC's CEO.\n",
      "40 minutes being good out of the whole movie is crazy ☠️\n",
      "Please keep Todd Phillips away from sequels lol.\n",
      "This movie left me saying “Wow, Todd Phillips has no idea as to how to handle a musical” I agree 100% with Greg, I always knew when a musical number was coming and I could see people shifting in their seats every time 🤦🏾‍♂️ \n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike The Color Purple 2024 - which did an excellent job at weaving normal dialogue into song which left you never knowing when a song would come.    Plus there was time to drive the emotional thru line of the scenes before going into song.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But this just felt like a very gifted dramatic/comedic director trying his hand at musical … and despite it being gorgeous and the performances are great (thou we needed more gaga) - the musical element is what makes it fall apart - and not because its a musical - but how it was executed!\n",
      "What would you rate this sequel out of 10?\n",
      "Todd Phillips seems to be really good at first movies but not sequels it seems\n",
      "What other character do you want an elseworlds story of?\n",
      "These guys are too nice, you can tell they don’t want to completely shit on it 😂\n",
      "I love these out of theater reactions they're so fun!! And the title told me everything I needed to know about how yall feel lol\n",
      "I feel like the movie has nothing to say, so the movie never really goes anywhere. Even in the third act \"shift,\" the movie has an opportunity to take off and deliver a big flourish to deliver some kind of payoff to what was leading up to it, but it never really commits to it and just kinda gives up. It's like the movie and its creators know how unnecessary it is and have nothing of any real substance to bring to it. And the final scene just feels like Todd Phillips begging through the frame, \"Please don't make me do a Joker 3.\"\n",
      "After sitting with my thoughts, I know this movie will actually hold a very special place in cinema. Once we all begin to accept it for what it was and how they just to conclude it. It’s quite poetic in all senses.\n",
      "I loved the movie! It wasn’t anything groundbreaking, but the way it incorporated the musical scenes throughout was satisfying. Watching this review before  might have made me love the movie even more!\n",
      "Lost me at the gambling sponsorship. Really disappointed with this decision.\n",

Like Joaquin’s Joker (who many feel isn’t a proper representation of the character), it’s safe to say Gaga’s Harley was always going to be very different than all the Harleys we’ve seen in other media. In short, she was meant to be a more grounded Harley. \n",

      " @joefratt  Just left the theater. Okay I did enjoy it but it didn’t hit like the first one. I see what they’re going for with the musical part of it but it’s slows the momentum and pacing. Wraps up his character and different take on Joker and Harley relationship. Could have been better but that ending gonna stay with me. I say 6/10\n",

      "So I went to see this at a fan-screening in IMAX and this was the first time I felt speechless and conflicted. For the first time, I felt divided watching a movie like this, but I might’ve raised my expectations a bit. I understood what it was saying, but it took me a while to understand. In my theater, the audio started to act weird and it made an interesting experience. A lot of people went to the kiosks and gave their complaints, because of that, everyone was given a rain check. Basically, I can watch another movie and any format for free. So, it was a win-win situation for me. Anyway, movie does look amazing in IMAX!\n",
      "Thank you for being actually critical about the movie.   Unlike some folks on YouTube\n",
      "Editors are so underrated.\n",
      "On the movie joker loves harlene quinzel and obsessed the fact that is the first clue that he is not a the real joker.joker in other we all knew that he doesn't give a dam about harlene and many times he sacrifice her to escaped 😅\n",
      "I see it tonight I’m actually still excited but I’m lowering my expectations going in\n",
      "Haven’t seen the movie yet but I believe it might be important going into it that the director and actors didn’t do this because the Joker movie called for a sequel. In fact, many people say it strongly didn’t, but both Todd and Joaquin wanted to because they wanted to explore the character and world more. That clues me in to the fact that are doing what THEY want with this movie, not what they think they should do or what the audience may want to see. In their eyes, they made the best movie possible because, again, it was for THEM. They made the art that they wanted to make. that’s also not to invalidate everyone’s criticisms of the movie but I appreciate the liberties they seem to take with that mindset. A lot of viewers will try to tell the filmmaker and actors that they made a “bad movie” but even if the movie isn’t my favorite, I’ll know it’s because it just wasn’t my cup of tea, not because the cast and crew who made it “failed” at doing so.\n",
      "I feel compelled to say that I think the movie is one of those that grows on you down the line. It's something that needs to be digested for a while. Fresh-out-of-the-theater reviews like yours are great for those curious, but it was too bold and preemptive to say that \"this movie's gonna be way more negative with audiences\" or that it's messy. There were no amateurish choices here. While watching, I was thinking, huh, it's like an arthouse foreign film that stands alone: no expectations just let it take you where it wants to go. And I felt Todd Phillips was gonna do it this way regardless or even despite of what the audience expects. So I enjoyed the experience and the conversations afterward.\n",
      "I haven’t seen it yet as I’m not huge fan of musicals but I’m happy to see your prospective. I just want to see Gaga acting in a non musical movie where I can forget she’s a singer and disconnect her from the real word. Currently I find it distracting because as a fan I know so much about her that she’d have to be Meryl Strip or up to help me forget she’s a real life singer.\n",
      "The movie was produced primarily because the studio and the previous installment grossed over a billion dollars. It's unsurprising that Todd Phillips has decided not to continue with these films. He wasn't keen on making this one. This situation is reminiscent of the last Matrix film; Lana Wachowski was reluctant to make it, but faced pressure with the ultimatum that if she didn't, someone else would. Consequently, we got the movie and story that we did.\n",
      "I want the people who made \"Penguin\" to do the same thing with Twoface and Joker.\n",
      "I watched this yesterday, I really enjoyed it although some musical pieces misfired. Sadly though, most critics hated it, I think the main reason is they were expecting a Joker movie but saw an Arthur Fleck movie instead.\n",
      "Arthur Fleck due to loneliness and dire situation created an alter ego The Joker, the alter ego started dominating him and ended up on a murderous spree, but because of this notoriety it resonated with the masses and made him a cult figure.\n",
      "In comes Lee Quinzel an obsessed fan who commited a crime just to meet The Joker, because of this Arthur felt the love for the first time and gave up his alter ego only to realize that no one loves Arthur and everyone loved The Joker including Lee Quinzel who at this point created her own persona.\n",
      "Heartbreaking for Arthur who is back  where he started, lonely and despaired. \n",
      "My favorite scene of the movie is when Arthur sang \"If You Go Away\", it truly encapsules the movie\n",
      "I watched it last night and I liked it all throughout, even the musicals were nice. I would see it again.\n",
      "Saw it. Liked it a lot. I wish I could say a lot more. But going again tomorrow.\n",
      "This is so sad man. I expected a lot more Gaga. I've heard that they cut a bunch of her scenes out. I was also expecting a duet, and the musicals to be a representation of their shared insanity rather than Arthur's fantasy.\n",
      "Spolier: joker doesn't kill a soul in this movie\n",
      "The ending is what did it for me, really left me feeling disappointed\n",
      "Todd Philips said that they made the movie feel like it is made by crazy people. This would suggest that it may not feel like it has a trajectory. Arthur is facing a situation and the following twists occur and this is what he feels and why he feels them. That is what I am getting from all the reviews, at least. Arthur does not seem to have a purpose so when the movie delves so much into his mind, it eventually loses its purpose too.\n",
      "Haven’t seen it but from what I’ve heard it seems like it’s a complete departure from the first film. Certainly an odd approach as a musical. Would have preferred to leave the first film on its own.\n",
      "If I seriously blame the writers for anything, it's that they didn't allow them to better understand how atrocious and infamous the world is with Arthur and his society being in its darkness even though he later became a common melancholic figure. And I think that without music nothing would happen!!\n",
      "The problem was that Joaquin Phoenix went nuts and he was rewriting the plot while filming the movie. That was confirmed by Lady Gaga.\n",
      "?? How did it go?\n",
      "He’s still taking it all in right about now\n",
      " @lkf8799  oh my gosh dude I’m so sorry i just saw this. And I actually loved it. Now it’s definitely not for everyone but neither is the first so i think everyone who liked the first should at least see it once and most importantly go in with an open mind. It’s a very different kind of movie than the first\n",
      " @Wardroberari  haha yeah it’s a lot to unpack lol\n",
      "True\n",
      "you should watch house of gucci then😊\n",
      " @mrsfahrenheit  I did but it wasn’t good. Her acting was ok but not outstanding. I found her acting in A Star Is Born better.\n",
      "He’s not the joker. That’s the bigger spoiler.\n",
      "Where\n",
      "Damn WB should've intervened .\n",
      " @joshuafult84  That's the joke. The only way that Todd Phillips was going to make the sequel was if WB were hands off. And that's what happened. The blame is 100% on Todd Phillips not the studio.\n",
      "Todd Phillips really is brilliant.. he made every decision for this movie exclusively to ensure he doesn’t have to make a third one.\n",
      "My biggest gripe with this movie was the whole Joker vs Arthur conflict. Like yes, I get it's supposed to be Arthur's mental battle between whether Joker is just a persona or who he really is, but wasn't it already established in that iconic bloody smile scene that he renounced himself as Arthur and fully accepted himself as Joker?\n",
      "\n",
      "So WHY the hell is he suddenly having second thoughts when he's already far gone? They basically reverse his transformation and have him go back to being poor unlucky Arthur in the end and it felt very anticlimactic. I myself love redemption stories, but Joker is NOT redeemable. And even then his redemption goes absolutely nowhere. Not to mention Harley leaving him because she doesn't like him anymore was such salt in the wound. If I'm understanding correctly, she's supposed to be his soul mate and the ONE good thing left in his life that understands him, and just like that she's just another person who's kicked him to the curb. Yes, that's life, but would it have killed them to leave him ONE person who genuinely loved him? It's like this movie's whole purpose was to continue kicking Arthur around like nothing's changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the whole point of Arthur's transformation into Joker was that he was fed up with being pushed around and decided to stand up and make those who are awful pay, even if it had to involve chaos. Yet in this movie, his response to someone who constantly pushed him around and really should've gotten what they F@$%IN DESERVED, is to do nothing and decide he doesn't wanna be Joker anymore because all of a sudden he feels bad. Like WTF?!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not to say I condone violence and chaos like Todd Phillips was probably scared this movie would glamorize, but HELLOOOOO this it the JOKER!! His whole thing is his love for violence and chaos, his lack of empathy and redeemable qualities, and most of all, his high status as a criminal. And that's what I was hoping this movie would dwell into; his rise to crime and possibly fighting Batman.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they at least ended it with him going back to being Joker again it would've at least had a better ending. But NOPE, we get a copout ending with him getting killed and the writers deciding \"SURPRISE he was never the real Joker, so you can just forget his whole origin story we fleshed out and established for you and focus on this rando who will be the new Joker. ENJOY!\" 🤨\n",
      "\n",
      "So in conclusion, this movie is a JOKE! And not the right kind.\n",
      "The only Jonkler musical I'd watch is w the Honky-Tonkler\n",
      "Great sequel. So fresh and unique.\n",
      "i saw like the biggest spoiler for the movie which is the ending and i am so confused on wheather i like it or hate it\n",
      "It’s starting to sound like the age old saying is true: Leave well enough alone.\n",
      "That ending was exactly what I expected so I guess I’m not disappointed\n",
      "You know what it's art it's subjective it is what it is\n",
      "The first one is iconic. Already a classic. This one will be forgoten only to be remembered in the bad sequences montages.\n",
      "He gets killed at the end, supposedly by the \"real\" Joker\n",
      "\"Some disdain for the first movie\" Yeah that is what sooo many people feel and I agree xD\n",
      "I like comic book movies & musicals/movie musicals but I'm really holding off on this. Im never a person who waits for streaming really tbh but might do that for this. But also haven't been looking forward to it when they announced a sequel I was like do we need a sequel? then saying it was a musical then Gaga & Todd saying it's not a musical yet they describe what a musical is😂\n",
      "Come on now, I can't be the only one who thinks Joker 2 is amazing!\n",
      "Joaquin and Gaga’s performance was amazing as the majority are saying but the plot was messy? The first half imo was really good but I think Todd adding the musical concept got in the way of the movie having a good build up and run through. Plus he cut out a lot of scenes especially THE ENDING and the ones with ‘Lee’ having more dialogue and not just singing every scene she’s in. She definitely was used enough to the point where it made sense for her to be in this universe with this Joker but her usage apart from singing? not as much. I think it’s also the reason why Gaga made a companion album ‘Harlequin’ that’s inspired by the movie. It’s her take on the character and because she said she felt like she wasn’t done with the character yet. The trailer and teasers were definitely clickbait😭 we need a directors cut\n",
      "The idea of a Joker musical movie isn't a bad one in my opinion, it's just too bad it was executed very poorly.\n",
      "Joker/Joker 2 is the first ever Gotham City tale - that I know of - told not from the perspective of a super-gifted hero, villain, or anti-hero, but straight from the bottom, from the point of view of an average person born into outsider circumstances. \n",
      "\n",
      "And then, after much of a struggle, for good as much as for being seen, Gotham City grinds him down, makes him spiteful, become a criminal, and even when he tries to accept what he had coming, exploits him further, desperately tries to play him for fortune or fame, to paint him either as a supervillain or as their own twisted version of a stand-in hero, denies to see him as what he really is, and ultimately kills him for standing up for himself, for owning his life, his history and deeds, his mistakes and also his lifelong illusions that he decided to finally shed once and for good, for all to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a depressing tale to tell, but a daring one. Because THIS Gotham City tale is holding up a mirror to our own society, by cutting away larger-than-life stand-in figures of authority and responsibility such as Bruce Wayne / The Batman or any larger-than-life supervillains to push the blame onto for everything that is wrong in society. \n",
      "\n",
      "And when you peel that back, the question remains: Is our society so much different from Gotham's, and either way what is our own role in shaping society that way? \n",
      "\n",
      "This is the one DC story that dares to go that far, the one where escapism doesn't triumph in the end, the one that takes the society of its own world to a more consistent and realistic conclusion. To me, it is a great depiction of Gotham City up from the bottom rather than from high above out of its manors, penthouses, skyscrapers and spires.\n",
      "Todd Phillips presents How to Leave a Billion Dollars on the Table🤔\n",
      "Okay, good! I'm not the only one who felt like I was trying to get through the movie at a certain point\n",

      "​ @Fade2Dark ok kiddo\n",
      " @Evan-k  you think I’m lying? Go see the movie yourself.\n",
      "It was!! I dont think a lot of people understand it at all they were so distracted by the musical side that they didnt get the big reveal!!\n",
      "I feel the main problem with Joker & Joker 2 is that most parts of the audience desperately wanted to watch them as movies about literally THE JOKER ™ such as these stories have been told over and over again before, and what they got instead were movies about Arthur Fleck, movies which merely toyed with certain elements from DC's The Batman lore, playing them partly for parallels, partly for contrast, partly for red herrings, partly for moral ambivalence and partly for narrative ambivalence (blurring lines between imagination and reality).\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, both movies had Arthur Fleck not as hero, villain nor antihero, but as a tragic protagonist, who is dealt a bad set of cards and makes the worst of it - with certain intentions and under certain circumstances, both of which he himself never fully grasps until it is too late. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a way, Arthur Fleck isn't more of a protagonist than the City of Gotham itself, as it is the interplay of Gotham's ruthlessness towards him, at least just as much as Arthur's own agency, together with the chance encounters he makes, that contributes to his downfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is indeed a very tragic one, the entire story of Arthur Fleck as it plays out over the course of Joker and Joker 2. The way I see it, these movies are only in part about Arthur Fleck's ultimate demise, but even more so about the ultimate triumph of  Gotham City's heart of darkness within its citizens' souls: All of them (as far as we can see, with only three exceptions of the smallest characters in them, a toddler Bruce Wayne, a man mocked for dwarfism, a single mother we barely get to see) take advantage of Arthur in one way or another. \n",
      "\n",
      "With the first movie, it was possible for parts of the audience to not get what it was about (a movie about Gotham City rather than THE Joker, a movie that tells us that in a city like Gotham the evolution of a Joker-like character is not a break away from the norm, but that staying innocent and pure would be a break from the norm - and ultimately lead to a life of exploitation, misery and pain) but rather to interpret it as an origin story of THE Joker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second movie sort of tells the same story (namely, that only the Joker role could raise people's interest in Fleck, either as an \"evil twin in control of him\" or as \"his true evil self\", no one cared what Arthur himself went through to have him arrive at his murders, outside of wearing the makeup of a madman), but this time it hammers home the point more heavily, leaving no way out of interpreting it as a movie about Gotham City and Arthur Fleck - not about THE Joker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both films are films about a society which is not only interested in but appreciates a Joker™, ANY Joker™ more than it appreciates an Arthur Fleck, more than a person who is kind to outsiders (be it on the job as in Joker, or in prison as in Joker 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "As things stand now, I assume that the first Joker movie was not well received for what it was going for, but rather for its misinterpretation; Joker 2, however, is not disliked for failing to achieve what it set out to do, but for driving home its theme even more so than the first one did; by drawing more attention to people outside of Arthur Fleck's immediate circle, to the media circus evolving around him, to people's self-interests projected onto him, to even the persons being closest to him (mother, Leen, lawyer) never trying to actually see and get to know him outside of how his \"image\" played a role in fulfilling their own self-interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can get out of the rut of expecting a bland DC villain origin story as told a gazillion times before in comics and movies, and if you are willing to settle instead for an extended tale of how Gotham City treats outsiders who are neither normies nor supergifted, then Joker & Joker 2 might work very well for you, actually; with part 1 focusing more on the abandonment by society and on cruelties dealt out on a personal level, and with part 2 focusing more on cruelties dealt out by institutions such as the prison system and the media, and on the abandonment and betrayal experienced on a more personal level.\n",
      "Joker 2 is a great movie. I don't understand the really bad reviews. Yes it was bleak, but beautifully so with a strong message on society. There is so much  to admire from the whole cast. And yes it's less plot based and more character driven  and i guess people wanted more Joker?  (Which was a theme mirrored through out the film too)\n",
      "Joaquin Phoenix is so compelling to watch. He draws you in and unsettles you. You never know what is coming. With the support of the phenomenaly talented Lady gaga I was totally absorbed through out.\n",
      "They should have come out with another version of the movie without any musical aspects. I think that's the movie we were hoping to get when they originally announced the sequel.\n",
      "99% of people wanted to see the Joker in Joker 2. What we got was Author. Even in the movie Author said “Author who?” In Joker 2 Author realized nobody wants him. They want the Joker. Just like us “The Audience” we want Joker! So, think about it. The movie played a Joke on you. You came to see the Joker but got Author and you didn’t even realize you are just like everyone else on the movie. Nobody likes Author. Author realized it and stopped being what everybody wanted. \n",

      "Even enough Todd Phillips, confirmed this is the last one. I really hope they make one more to make up for this one. Hopefully it can be up there with the first one if not better than both movies.\n",
      "I honestly didn't mind it at all. Not as good as the first, but I enjoyed it. The viewer and Gotham wanted Arthur to be the Joker so bad. I think that was the point. He never was the Joker - he started the trend.\n",
      "If they release part 3 with Phoenix (I saw the second movie), this could be the greatest trilogy of all time\n",
      "This movie, doesnt have Matrix' action scenes, but just like those movies this had real events(car bomb, Arthur getting stabbed)  that paralleled his mental( courthouse blowing up, Gaga shooting him) that keeps you tuned in\n",
      "I completely loved the first Joker movie. I couldn’t wait to see this second one, especially after watching the trailer, but after hearing all these reviews, I’m not sure if I want to risk watching this one because I don’t want it to ruin anything that I enjoyed from the first one. It’s pretty clear they didn’t make this sequel for the same audience that enjoyed the first movie, which is strange because you’d think they would want another success. Biggest disappointment of the year..\n",

      "You know, if DC truly wanted to make a great Musical idea? They could have used a Batman villain whose whole gimmick is music, The Music Meister! In the past Neil Patrick Harris played him, imagine if we got a different stage actor to play him in a classic La La Land style film with a psychological thriller side. It could feature some popular Batman characters as well and give each their own musical style, like I’m thinking Riddler could have either a showman or Elton John style, Magpie (who’s a kleptomaniac villain obsessed with anything shiny) could have either a tango, or Maria and The Diamonds style, Scarecrow could have a Billie Eilish style, and Harley Quinn could have an electro swing jazz or vaudeville style. Music Meister could either have the music in his mind or make it his own powers forcing people to sing their inner thoughts like in the show Batman Brave and The Bold. If I was casting I’d choose broadway actor Aaron Tevitt as Music Meister, Anya Taylor Joy as Harley Quinn, YouTuber Annapantsu as Magpie, Neil Patrick Harris as The Riddler, and maybe Adam Lambert as Scarecrow.\n",

It's about a man who's psychotic who happens to take on a \"Joker\" persona. Heck. It's more realistic than Snyder's Sucker Punch. This movie is literally about a psycho in the real world.\n",

In part 2, the best part is the courtroom scene. That had me so thrilled that THIS is the Joker we love. Then, he goes back to Arkham to get prison shower raped by a gang of guards. Then, he reverts back to Arthur and recanted his Joker persona. Just totally destroyed what we came to love. A slap to face\n",
      "I liked it. I feel a lot of people are being dramatic about the musical aspect and ridiculous about the end. It was always a elseworld story and the first film made it clear. He is Arthur fleck he is 30 plus years older then bruce cmon\n",
      "I think the Director dislikes the kind of people that loves the 1st movie for reasons he didn’t agree with\n",
      "I disagree a little. In my opinion the point of the movie was to showcase him in a way battling who he is, the joker or Arthur. There are shifts in the music where it goes from just voices to a dark tonal shift in the instrumental followed by more theatrics and clearer singing almost showing that he became the joker. I think it also showcases the unreliable narrator what is real what isn’t, is he actually singing or is it in his head. I think this movie added on to how he became the joker like the court room scene that ah now I that’s the joker we know but also a commentary on he’s preforming as people want him to be. I found it to be a great addition especially cause the first one really is meant to show his downward spiral into a full psychotic break. My friend also made an interesting observation what if the psycho at the end is the true joker who adapts the persona and Arthur is just that, Arthur.\n",

After how much Todd spoke about not caring about the media's ideas of Joker and speaking for the voiceless during the campaign in 2019, this is so disappointing! I'm just gonna pretend there was no sequel. Joaquin did play the part perfectly in Folie A Deux though.\n",

Considering the ending of the first part and knowing that it was only his imagination because he didn't kill anyone at the end, the new ending can be interpreted as the death of Arthur in his subconscious and the birth of the Joker, who no longer has any remorse.\n",

      "I actually loved it. He always felt like Joker but not quite like Joker, he isn't the agent  of chaos and disorder who is a terrorist/mastermind/crime boss for sake of a msg/laughs or Batman. And never was going to be.   Joker isn’t a  tragic/sympathetic-emo reactionary + can ya see a 70 yr old Arthur fighting Batman? Bruce is a kid. Arthur served as the proto / inspiration w/ that ending and that Joker more of an ideology. (Also, in comics they did a 3 Joker story)\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that’s the problem. Everyone had their minds made assumed he was just Joker - for me I never completely felt it. Missing a point they cannot see w/o feeling that way too.  Lot more nuanced than to just say it was a rehash of first. He didn’t feel alone anymore. Fell in love. And for him to be love starved / touch starved. Imagine how’d that make him feel and after 2 yrs he was in Arkham, he became far removed from Joker /fantasy world and his acts. As compared to who he was his whole life. And still receiving some forms of abuse he has. But we saw Different perspectives and ramifications for first. Got to hear even more testimonies how awful his mom was, endured, there wasn’t anything to build upon or develop cause he’s a version of Joker but he’s not. And never going to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "His death.  Can think of it as him dying by hand of an obsessed fan betrayed on tv like Murr-ARY. But he cuts a smile, laughs to take it on - you know how monumental that would be to make a mark, for how Arthur and his killings impacted Gotham. We seen bits enough of him, that blind side makes it even more powerful.  Ideology of Joker passed/embraced, til next. not a tragically doomed life Arthur was in the end. He couldn’t claim being Joker cause of awful things done to him and who he was truly at his core. And he was never loved for who  he is and why it might cause a split. Can’t remember if it was said but how much more tragic was if visitor is Lee he was on his way to see.\n",

Let us enjoy the film without all this overblown, irrelevant nonsense.\n",

      "My main issue with this movie is within 30 minutes of the movie you realize it’s no longer targeting the main demographic for superhero/villain movies. It starts targeting people that want to look into a deeper  meaning behind what it’s trying to portray. And to be honest that’s sort of a loss considering the movies demographic is there for JOKER which happens to be the tittle of the movie. But instead they want you to think more in depth when in reality that’s not what the common joker loving fan wants. It’s one thing to try and impose commentary about something but it’s another when you’re preaching to the wrong set of people. I just don’t think they made a joker movie. They made an antithesis to one.\n",
      "I honestly really liked it\n",
      "Was my worry. I was fine with the use of the musical element but it over did it. Some good scenes but i feel they copped out as the story progressed and then having him distance himself from the joker. The best musical part was definitely the prison break.\n",

OF COURSE, the film is going to be INSANE. And for that, I loved it. It is truly one of the most boldest films I've seen to date to take such a risk. The Joker is an idea, Arthur became the Joker after one bad day, Lee wanted to exist inside Joker's realm so she became a female Joker. Then... Some say, the REAL Joker came in at the end. Fleck's Joker ALWAYS wore red suits, he never wore the iconic purple. Why? Maybe because that Joker was the psychopath at the end, glasglow smile and all.\n",

      "@Y-E-R-I  \"to want to explore that side of him after the first movie is literally the normalest thing to ask for\".....that's literally EXACTLY what this second film did though? It very clearly showcased his problems just as the first one did, and how misunderstood he is. As I already said, the point of the film was to show how people were not focusing on Arthur, not sympathizing with him, and only cared about Joker which Arthur wanted to move away from. The interview scene where he kept being called Joker and the interviewer was told to stop and then he got lectured by Arthur to quit recalling the past and focus on who he is now? The musical elements being a part of his mental state? Literally everything about the film was a character study just as the first one is. I'm so confused.\n",
      " @luna-mo3ol  the first one was executed better. maybe it's my personal opinion, but most of the scenes did not capture me like the first one did. maybe it's because i only saw the first movie once in 2019, but honestly i don't recall getting as bored as i was while watching joker 2 in the movie theater. i also think the movie is so focused on the audience reaction to the first one that it feels like you need to know exactly what people were saying. but i hadn't thought about what were the takes about joker 1 since 2019, so i honestly didn't even think it was directly calling out the audience for misunderstand the first one. i just felt like i was missing something. anyway, the end also felt predictable, since arthur faced the consequences of his actions, i suspected he was going to (spoilers) die, and it was exactly what happened lmao. it didn't really feel satisfactory or cathartic. if he at least got the chair it would be better, but shoehorning \"here's the ACTUAL joker guys, the other one was just a prototype!\" feels.... stupid.\n",
      "@Y-E-R-I   I can understand that, it's just that you talked in your original comment as if the second one didn't at all do what the first one did which, it very much did. With the ending, honestly I loved it. When you say ACTUAL joker, that's actually not a correct way of saying it. As, in the comics, there are many variations of Joker. He's essentially different people at different points in time, with different names. So there is no and has never been an ACTUAL joker as he has always been different people. At the very least, no one really even knows what his real name truly is which gives the indication that yeah, he's different people sometimes. Also, the name \"Arthur Fleck\" from what I understand has never even appeared in the comics, so..... again, multiple people and identites. That ending made perfect sense.\n",
      " @m3dkit385  Wow, people wanted Joker in a Joker movie? \n",
      "\n",
      "Well shit, imagine that.\n",
      " @jeebus2313  well we learned from the first Joker that Bruce Wayne was like 10 years old... I dont know why you would have thought Arthur was the true Joker? Why did you watch the second one if we learned in the first one, Arthur truly never was the real \"Joker\"? He started the trend that was brought on by Gotham. Arthur never cared about the true identity.\n",
      " @luna-mo3ol  yes, i know the joker has no confirmed identity, but it felt more like a \"here you go fans of the character, nothing changed, you still get a crazy silly clown guy!\" rather than something actually interesting at all. and even if the joker has multiple identities (for what i know of there is a specific comic about that, but he's treated like the same guy in most media) it felt undeserved, and like it was trying to tie a loose thread of \"well if arthur isn't the joker than someone HAS to be\" because he's a fan favorite and batman's dark reflection and all, nothing else.\n",
      " @m3dkit385  Literally this.\n",
      "@Y-E-R-I  \"rather than something actually interesting at all\" okay so, what could they have been done that you would've found interesting especially with the ending? And do you mean it felt undeserved like Arthur should've ended up being the real joker?\n",
      " @luna-mo3ol  no, but if they wanted to go with a death ending, him going out on the chair would feel more cathartic i think, at least more than just having it be maybe \"THE joker!!!\". it feels sudden and like they were trying to get some cute little easter eggs so comic fans don't get too offended by arthur's character arc conclusion. but tbh i'm no film maker or writer i just thought the movie was mid despite great actors and good cinematography\n",
      "@Y-E-R-I  I think him just going out on a chair without any correlation of what could come after would actually be throwing away the story and character of sorts. Doing what they did with having a new joker come into play was, as you said, an Easter egg and a fun one at that, and it gives opportunity for possibly more to come. Who knows, if they did a third one with a story about JOKER, rather than the character under that, that would get the fans what they want as we haven't had a standalone joker film that really explores that side of him, so it would be a win win for everyone. People who enjoyed the psychology behind joker would like these two films. With the ending, we now get an opportunity to explore a joker actually playing that part like what other fans want. Like I said, win-win\n",
      " @luna-mo3ol  not at all. we are not invested in this character, they are a rando in arkham. we have had build up to arthur and knew his life, why he turned violent and how it affected him. having a random guy be the next joker is so tasteless. we don't have the same connection to him, and a standalone wouldn't work as well as the first movie did. the mysterious joker with no known identity or backstory is a concept that only works when you have a batman character to try to solve the mystery. and from what you said yourself, it doesn't even look like the director would want to make a 3rd movie anyway, since he was so against audience reactions to the first one. it felt like cutting the line for the movie series, and i think doing it in a way in which arthur's actions would catch up to him no matter what fantasies he had would have worked better with the theme of the film.\n",
      "@Y-E-R-I  But Arthur was a rando before we saw the first film. Who's to say we won't build a connection of sorts or be entertained by another film with this other joker? And I never said a third film wouldn't include batman because it probably would. Maybe an origin of how he and batman came to be enemies or something of the sort, with a start of how joker started to make a name for himself as a villain. I'm pretty sure the director also said the same thing after the first film that he wouldn't make a sequel (I could be wrong) but here we are. Even if HE said he wouldn't make a third one, a different director might. I think it's certainly possible. I also do think a \"THE Joker\" movie would work as a standalone movie too (and by standalone I'm talking about only being focused on that character without batman or any other characters like that in the mix) simply because people were mad about this film not portraying more of Arthur's joker side. People clearly really wanna see more of that and that's why so many people hate this film (aside from the musical elements). But, we both clearly have different views and that's fine lol. I did also wanna mention that I notice you're a kpop fan and I am too - i just thought that had to be mentioned as this is an interesting collide between fandoms (kpop and dc) 😂\n",

      "No intention to insult the audience, but a large part of me feels like y'all didn't like Joker 2 because it wasn't the story y'all thought it was, DESPITE the first movie literally telling you EXACTLY what story this was. This movie, just like it's predecessor, is a commentary on mental illness. It's us, the comic book fans, who attached our own feelings to the character and formed our own opinions. The first movie is about a man with mental illness that snaps and goes into basically a manic state. The second movie is about that man dealing with ramifications of his actions. WE thought after the first movie that he'd evolved into the iconic comic character, because I think we wanted him to, mental illness or not. It crossed very little if at all in any of our minds that this man could feel remorse or regret after what he'd done, that maybe sitting in prison or taking meds could change his outlook. We saw him descend into madness, and we assumed him at his lowest was just who he was now and always, but that's obviously not how mental illness works. There's no Oscar the first movie was nominated for that I don't think this one will be as well, but I think so much disappointment towards this movie is coming from the fact that this character in this movie is NOT The Joker, and much like the people around him in the movie, the audience wants him to be that guy. They want him to be the crazy, evil, heartless person who is always capable of making jokes at any moment. And he's not that guy. And there's nothing wrong with wanting that guy, but the reason I think the disappointment is somewhat unwarranted is because the first movie TOLD us he wasn't that guy, but the audience(myself included) ignored what the movie literally showed and told us for the sake of our own narrative and attachment to a long standing, previously existing character. But he never was that character. And the final nail in the coffin for how we know this? That character we all know; The Joker, HAS NO ORIGIN STORY. He never has. This is a different character and a different man, and I think recognizing and accepting that will ultimately lead to seeing the beauty of both films' commentaries. That's All Folks.\n",
      "What annoys me isn’t that’s it’s bad, but the actual point of the film. Like, what is it that Todd Philips is trying to say? I can’t even begin to start analyzing. I know it’s about identity, but what the fuck.\n",

Or are you going to tell me that the real Joker is the forgettable character who kills Arthur at the end of the second film?\n",

He is on full copium for believing that and creating Joker 2. Hopefully DC hired a better director maybe like Matt Reeves to direct a true sequel for Joker because Phoenix and his character as the Joker deserves better.
